        "DESIGN_INSIGHT": "### DESIGN_INSIGHT_1: Linearizing and Diagonalizing RNN Recurrence for Efficient Long-Range Dependency Modeling\n\nThis paper demonstrates that removing nonlinearities from the RNN recurrence (i.e., using a linear recurrence) and reparameterizing the recurrence matrix to be complex and diagonal (rather than dense) enables both efficient parallel training and robust modeling of long-range dependencies. This approach, when coupled with nonlinear MLP/GLU blocks between recurrent layers, maintains expressivity for complex sequence modeling while avoiding the vanishing/exploding gradient issues typical of deep RNNs. The diagonalization further allows for parallel scan algorithms, drastically speeding up training and inference, matching the efficiency of state-space models (SSMs) like S4.",

Gains should be most pronounced on tasks where sequence length and dependency distance are high. No degradation is expected on factual or structured tasks (arc_easy/challenge, swde), and baseline performance should be maintained on commonsense and reasoning tasks (piqa, social_iqa, boolq).\n\n**Architectural_Symptoms**: Training curves will show faster convergence and more stable loss, especially on long-context tasks, with reduced memory usage and higher throughput per training step compared to standard RNNs or transformers.",

        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**: Replace the standard RNN recurrence \\( x_k = \\sigma(A x_{k-1} + B u_k) \\) with a linear, complex-diagonal recurrence \\( x_k = \\Lambda x_{k-1} + B u_k \\), where \\( \\Lambda \\) is a learned diagonal matrix with complex entries. Nonlinearities are moved to position-wise MLP/GLU blocks between recurrent layers.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**: By linearizing the recurrence and diagonalizing the transition matrix, the model avoids sequential bottlenecks and enables parallel scan computation. This also allows for direct control and analysis of eigenvalue dynamics, sidestepping vanishing/exploding gradients and enabling stable propagation of information over long sequences.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**:\n- Recurrence: \\( x_k = \\Lambda x_{k-1} + B u_k \\), where \\( \\Lambda = \\text{diag}(\\lambda_1, ..., \\lambda_N) \\), \\( \\lambda_j \\in \\mathbb{C} \\)\n- Output: \\( y_k = C x_k + D u_k \\)\n- Nonlinear blocks: Applied after each recurrent layer, e.g., \\( x'_k = \\text{GLU}(x_k) \\)\n\n**Computational_Properties**: Time and space complexity scales linearly with sequence length. Diagonalization allows for efficient parallelization (parallel scan), and memory access patterns are regular and cache-friendly.

Ensure normalization before or after the recurrence.\n\n**Parameter_Settings**: Initialize diagonal entries of \\( \\Lambda \\) uniformly on the complex unit disk (see Lemma 3.2), with magnitude close to 1 for long-range tasks. Use Glorot or similar initialization for input/output projections. Nonlinear block parameters follow standard initialization.\n\n**Application_Conditions**: Apply when the model is expected to handle very long sequences or when training/inference efficiency is a bottleneck. Especially valuable for tasks with high context length and dependency distance (e.g., narrative completion, multi-hop QA).\n\n**Expected_Outcomes**: Improved performance and convergence speed on long-context tasks, with efficient resource utilization and no loss of expressivity for complex sequence-to-sequence mappings. Training loss curves should be smoother and converge faster than with nonlinear/dense RNNs or transformers."

        "DESIGN_INSIGHT": "### DESIGN_INSIGHT_2: Stable Exponential Parameterization and Forward-Pass Normalization for Long-Range Stability\n\nThe paper shows that parameterizing the diagonal recurrence matrix \\( \\Lambda \\) via a stable exponential form—separately learning magnitude (via negative exponentials) and phase (frequency)—enables precise control over the recurrence's eigenvalues, directly enforcing stability (i.e., keeping \\( |\\lambda_j| \\leq 1 \\)). This, combined with a normalization scheme for the hidden state (scaling by a factor dependent on the eigenvalue's distance from the unit circle), prevents forward-pass blow-up or vanishing, especially when initializing eigenvalues close to the unit circle to capture long-range dependencies. For extremely long sequences, further restricting the phase (frequency) range at initialization is crucial for generalization.",
        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures**: Expect robust improvements on the most challenging long-range tasks (lambada_openai, squad_completion, winogrande, hellaswag) and on tasks where previous models failed to generalize (e.g., PathX analogs). Training loss will remain stable even when eigenvalues are close to the unit circle, and models will avoid sudden loss spikes or plateaus. No negative impact is expected on short-sequence or structured tasks.\n\n**Architectural_Symptoms**: Without this innovation, models with eigenvalues near 1 will show training instability, loss blow-up, or poor generalization on very long sequences. With it, training remains stable and generalization is improved, especially on tasks with extreme sequence lengths.",
