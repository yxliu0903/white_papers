        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures**:  \n- Expect training loss curves to converge as smoothly as standard transformers, but with reduced compute and memory cost per token, especially as context length increases.  \n- lambada_openai and hellaswag scores should remain competitive with transformers, indicating strong narrative/context modeling, while long-context tasks (e.g., squad_completion, extended arc_easy/challenge) may show improved or at least stable performance as context length grows.  \n- Structured data extraction (swde) and factual QA (openbookqa, boolq) should not degrade, confirming the model’s ability to retain factual and pattern information over long spans.  \n- Commonsense and reasoning tasks (piqa, social_iqa, winogrande) should match transformer baselines, but may reveal limitations if extremely fine-grained, token-level recall is required.\n\n**Architectural_Symptoms**:  \n- During inference, memory and compute usage scales linearly with sequence length (O(Td)), enabling practical deployment for much longer contexts and larger batch sizes. Training remains parallelizable, with no loss of convergence stability.",

        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**:  \nRWKV replaces the standard quadratic self-attention with a linear-time, channel-wise attention mechanism that uses a learned, exponentially decaying time-weight (W) and a “receptance” gate (R) to modulate the contribution of past tokens. Each residual block contains a time-mixing and channel-mixing sub-block, both employing this mechanism. The “WKV” operator aggregates past information using a recurrent, time-decayed sum over key/value pairs, with the current token gated by a sigmoid of the receptance vector.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**:  \nThis approach enables the model to efficiently summarize and propagate information from all previous tokens using a single recurrent state per channel, avoiding the memory and compute explosion of quadratic attention. The time-decay and gating mechanisms allow selective focus on relevant past information, mitigating vanishing/exploding gradients and supporting deep stacking.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**:  \n- Time-mixing projections (for each t):\n    - rₜ = W_r · (μ_r ⊙ xₜ + (1-μ_r) ⊙ xₜ₋₁)\n    - kₜ = W_k · (μ_k ⊙ xₜ + (1-μ_k) ⊙ xₜ₋₁)\n    - vₜ = W_v · (μ_v ⊙ xₜ + (1-μ_v) ⊙ xₜ₋₁)\n- WKV operator:\n    - wkvₜ = [Σ_{i=1}^{t-1} exp(- (t-1-i) w + k_i) ⊙ v_i + exp(u + kₜ) ⊙ vₜ] / [Σ_{i=1}^{t-1} exp(- (t-1-i) w + k_i) + exp(u + kₜ)]\n- Output gating:\n    - oₜ = W_o · [σ(rₜ) ⊙ wkvₜ]\n\n**Computational_Properties**:  \n- Inference: O(Td) time and O(d) memory per token (linear in sequence length, constant in memory for recurrent state).\n- Training: Matrix multiplications and projections are fully parallelizable; only the WKV operator is sequential, but can be parallelized across batch and feature dimensions.\n- Highly efficient for long sequences and large models; enables scaling to >10B parameters with practical hardware.",
        "IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE": "**Integration_Strategy**:  \n- Replace transformer attention blocks with RWKV residual blocks, each containing a time-mixing and a channel-mixing sub-block.\n- Insert the WKV operator in place of self-attention, using channel-wise decay vectors.\n- Maintain layer normalization before/after each sub-block for gradient stability.\n- During training, use time-parallel mode for efficiency; during inference, use time-sequential mode for minimal memory.\n\n**Parameter_Settings**:  \n- Decay vector w: learnable, constrained to non-negative values (enforce via softplus or ReLU).\n- Token shift/interpolation coefficients μ_r, μ_k, μ_v: learnable per block/channel, initialized near 0.5 for balanced mixing.\n- Small initial embedding values, followed by LayerNorm, accelerate early convergence.\n- Use custom initialization (e.g., near-identity for linear layers, zero bias) to maintain stable information flow in deep stacks.\n\n**Application_Conditions**:  \n- Use RWKV when scaling to long context lengths (e.g., >2k tokens) or when inference efficiency is critical (edge, CPU, or memory-constrained environments).\n- Particularly beneficial when training large models with limited compute, or when batch sizes/context windows must be increased.\n- For tasks requiring extremely detailed, token-level recall over very long contexts, monitor for possible performance plateaus.\n\n**Expected_Outcomes**:  \n- Comparable or improved performance to transformers on most language modeling and QA tasks, with much lower compute/memory requirements at inference.\n- Smoother and more predictable training loss curves, robust scaling with model and context size.\n- Ability to process much longer sequences without degradation in narrative, factual, or commonsense reasoning tasks."

        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**:  \nThe RWKV block uses a “token shift” mechanism, where each time-mixing and channel-mixing projection interpolates between the current and previous token’s input. This is implemented as a simple offset in the temporal dimension, enabling effective mixing of local and past information. LayerNorm is applied before each sub-block and after the embedding layer, stabilizing activations and gradients throughout deep stacks.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**:  \nToken shift ensures that each layer receives a blend of recent and prior context, improving gradient flow and information propagation. LayerNorm prevents activation explosion or collapse, making it feasible to train deep (40+ layer) models with recurrent and attention-like computations.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**:  \n- For input xₜ and previous xₜ₋₁, projection:\n    - yₜ = W · [μ ⊙ xₜ + (1-μ) ⊙ xₜ₋₁]\n- LayerNorm(x) = (x - mean(x)) / sqrt(var(x) + ε)\n\n**Computational_Properties**:  \n- Token shift adds negligible overhead (simple tensor offset).\n- LayerNorm is standard and highly parallelizable.\n- Both contribute to stable, efficient training for large/deep models.",
