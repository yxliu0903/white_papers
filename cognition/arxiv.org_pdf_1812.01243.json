        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures**:  \n- Models with efficient attention display similar or improved training loss convergence versus standard dot-product attention, especially on large-context or high-resolution inputs, due to the ability to scale attention to deeper or wider network regions.  \n- Tasks requiring long-range dependency modeling (lambada_openai, hellaswag, winogrande, squad_completion) show stable or slightly improved scores, as efficient attention preserves the representational power of dot-product attention while enabling its use in more layers or at higher input resolutions.  \n- Computationally intensive or resource-limited tasks (fda, swde) benefit from the reduced memory/computation, allowing larger batch sizes or input contexts, which may indirectly improve few-shot and extraction generalization.  \n- No degradation is expected on factual/reasoning benchmarks (arc_easy/challenge, boolq, openbookqa, piqa, social_iqa), as the mechanism is mathematically equivalent to standard attention under scaling normalization.\n  \n**Architectural_Symptoms**:  \n- Resource monitoring shows linear (O(n)) memory/computation scaling with input length, enabling attention in places previously infeasible (e.g., early layers, high-res features, long sequences).",

        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**:  \n- Efficient attention replaces the standard O(n²) dot-product attention computation with an equivalent or near-equivalent O(n) method by reordering matrix multiplications: instead of (QKᵗ)V, compute Q(KᵗV).  \n- This exploits associativity: the aggregation over values is performed globally first (via key-weighted sums), then position-specific outputs are generated by mixing these global context vectors using the queries as coefficients.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**:  \n- By first summarizing input features into a small set of semantic context vectors (template attention maps) and then letting each position combine them, the model achieves the same global receptive field and dependency modeling as standard attention, but with drastically reduced resource usage.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**:  \n- Standard attention: D(Q,K,V) = ρ(QKᵗ)V  \n- Efficient attention: E(Q,K,V) = ρ_q(Q) [ρ_k(K)ᵗ V]  \n  Where ρ, ρ_q, ρ_k are normalization functions (scaling or softmax).  \n- Under scaling normalization, D(Q,K,V) ≡ E(Q,K,V); under softmax, they are close approximations.\n\n**Computational_Properties**:  \n- Memory: O(dn + d²) (vs O(n²) for standard attention)  \n- Computation: O(d²n) (vs O(dn²))  \n- Easily parallelizable; fits into existing transformer-style architectures as a drop-in replacement; enables larger input contexts or more attention layers within fixed resource budgets.",
        "IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE": "**Integration_Strategy**:  \n- Replace standard attention modules in transformer blocks with efficient attention modules; modify the computation graph to perform KᵗV before multiplying by Q.  \n- Use identical input projections (to Q, K, V) as standard attention.  \n- Insert efficient attention in deeper/higher-resolution layers or additional blocks, leveraging the reduced resource footprint.\n\n**Parameter_Settings**:  \n- Key/query dimensionality (dₖ): can be reduced (e.g., 32–128) without significant performance loss, further improving efficiency.  \n- Normalization: scaling or softmax; softmax is recommended for NLP tasks (as in transformers), with row/column softmax for Q/K respectively.  \n- Initialization and scaling rules: follow standard transformer best practices.\n\n**Application_Conditions**:  \n- Apply when memory/computation bottlenecks prevent use of standard attention (e.g., long sequences, high-res inputs, deep models).  \n- Particularly beneficial for tasks where global context is crucial but quadratic cost is prohibitive.\n\n**Expected_Outcomes**:  \n- Enables attention over longer contexts, higher-resolution features, or deeper models, resulting in improved or at least stable performance on long-range/contextual benchmarks (lambada_openai, hellaswag, squad_completion, winogrande).  \n- Training loss decreases more smoothly due to increased model capacity and context.  \n- No regression in factual, commonsense, or extraction tasks; may see indirect gains in fda/swde via increased context size or batch size."

        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**:  \n- Instead of generating a unique attention map per token/position, efficient attention decomposes the global context into a small set of template attention maps (one per key dimension), each summarizing a semantic aspect of the input.  \n- Each token’s output is then formed by weighting these global templates using its query as coefficients.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**:  \n- This template-based decomposition enables the model to capture major semantic axes of variation in the input, improving parameter efficiency and interpretability, while retaining the ability to model complex global dependencies.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**:  \n- For n positions, dₖ key dimensions:  \n  - Compute dₖ global context vectors: g_j = Σ_i K_{i,j} V_i  \n  - For each position i, output: o_i = Σ_j Q_{i,j} g_j  \n- This is equivalent to E(Q,K,V) above.\n\n**Computational_Properties**:  \n- Substantially fewer per-position computations; enables analysis and visualization of global context vectors; robust to reduction in dₖ.",
