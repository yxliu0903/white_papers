Gains may also be reflected in arc_easy/challenge and openbookqa due to improved factual and reasoning abilities from better context aggregation, but effects on swde and fda may be less pronounced unless those tasks require global pattern recognition.\n\n**Architectural_Symptoms**: Training dynamics will show more stable convergence and less sensitivity to input order or patch arrangement, with models demonstrating resilience to spatial shuffling or positional noise.",

        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**: Before processing visual (or sequential) representations with a State Space Model (SSM), apply a 2D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to the feature map to obtain its amplitude spectrum. Fuse this spectrum with the original feature map (elementwise addition, weighted by trainable parameters α and β), then feed the result into the SSM encoder. This enables the model to simultaneously access both spatial and frequency (global) information at every layer.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**: The FFT provides translation-invariant, global context: every frequency component reflects patterns across the entire input, so adding frequency-domain information ensures that each token/patch is informed by the whole input, not just its local neighborhood. This mitigates the loss of spatial relationships caused by flattening or serial scanning, giving SSMs a true global receptive field without quadratic cost.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**:\n- Let \\( X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{H \\times W \\times C} \\) be the feature map.\n- Compute 2D FFT: \\( F = \\text{FFT2D}(X) \\), take amplitude: \\( A = |F| \\).\n- Fuse: \\( X' = \\alpha \\cdot X + \\beta \\cdot A \\), where \\( \\alpha, \\beta \\) are learnable scalars.\n- Feed \\( X' \\) into the SSM (e.g., Mamba block).\n\n**Computational_Properties**: \n- FFT2D has \\( O(HW \\log H \\log W) \\) complexity, which is sub-quadratic and negligible compared to attention for moderate H, W.\n- No additional trainable parameters beyond α, β.\n- Fusion is parallelizable and does not affect SSM’s linear sequence complexity.\n- Memory access is regular; FFTs are well-optimized on modern hardware.",
        "IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE": "**Integration_Strategy**: Insert an FFT2D+amplitude computation and fusion step before each SSM encoder block (or a subset of blocks for efficiency). After patch embedding and before SSM, compute the amplitude spectrum and add it to the feature map, scaling each with its respective trainable parameter. The fused representation is then processed by the SSM as usual.\n\n**Parameter_Settings**: \n- Initialize α, β to 1.0 (or small positive values), and allow them to be learned per block or globally.\n- Apply layer normalization after fusion if needed for stability.\n- FFT can be computed on each channel independently or across channels as appropriate.\n\n**Application_Conditions**: \n- Use when observed model performance is limited by inability to integrate global context, especially on tasks involving long-range dependencies (e.g., narrative, reasoning, or factual QA).\n- Particularly beneficial when flattening or serializing high-dimensional input destroys spatial relationships.\n\n**Expected_Outcomes**: \n- Expect smoother and faster training loss decrease, improved generalization to long-context tasks (lambada_openai, squad_completion, winogrande), and enhanced performance on context-heavy reasoning tasks (arc_easy/challenge, openbookqa).\n- Computational cost increase is modest and justified by performance gains."
