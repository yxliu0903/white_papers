        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures**: \n- This innovation enables linear scaling with input length, allowing effective training and inference on very long sequences (thousands of tokens) without substantial loss in modeling quality. Expect to see:\n  - Comparable or slightly improved training loss convergence compared to standard self-attention, especially as sequence length increases.\n  - Markedly improved lambada_openai, hellaswag, and squad_completion scores for long-context tasks, due to preserved global context modeling.\n  - Stable or improved performance on arc_easy/challenge, boolq, piqa, social_iqa, winogrande, and openbookqa, since the approximation retains the core information flow of full attention.\n  - Substantially reduced memory footprint and wall-clock time for long sequences (reflected in smoother, more stable training loss curves and faster convergence).\n**Architectural_Symptoms**: \n- Models with this mechanism maintain or improve task performance on long-context benchmarks, with training curves that do not degrade as sequence length grows; memory and runtime scale linearly with sequence length.",

        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**: \n- Replace the standard quadratic self-attention with a Nyström-based approximation: select a small set of \"landmark\" tokens from the input (via segment-wise means), compute attention only between all tokens and these landmarks, and reconstruct the full attention matrix as a product of three smaller matrices. \n- The softmax attention is approximated as:  \n  \\( \\hat{S} = \\text{softmax}(Q\\tilde{K}^T/\\sqrt{d}) Z^+ \\text{softmax}(\\tilde{Q}K^T/\\sqrt{d}) \\),  \n  where \\( \\tilde{Q}, \\tilde{K} \\) are the landmark queries/keys, and \\( Z^+ \\) is the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of the landmark attention matrix.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**: \n- By using a small set of representative landmarks, the model captures global context and low-rank structure in attention patterns, dramatically reducing computation and memory while retaining the essence of full attention.\n- The landmark selection (segment-means) preserves local and global information, and the three-matrix multiplication reconstructs approximate pairwise dependencies.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**: \n- Landmark selection:  \n  \\( \\tilde{q}_j = \\frac{1}{l} \\sum_{i=(j-1)l+1}^{jl} q_i \\), for \\( j=1,...,m \\), where \\( l = n/m \\)\n- Nyström attention:  \n  \\( \\hat{S} = \\text{softmax}(Q\\tilde{K}^T/\\sqrt{d}) Z^+ \\text{softmax}(\\tilde{Q}K^T/\\sqrt{d}) \\)\n- Final output:  \n  \\( \\hat{Y} = \\hat{S} V \\)\n- \\( Z^+ \\) is computed iteratively for efficiency.\n\n**Computational_Properties**: \n- Time and memory complexity: \\( O(nm) \\) where \\( m \\ll n \\)\n- Highly parallelizable (all steps are matrix-matrix multiplications)\n- Landmark selection and pseudoinverse computation are efficient and GPU-friendly (no full \\( n \\times n \\) attention matrix ever formed)\n- Enables training and inference on sequences an order of magnitude longer than standard transformers with similar hardware.",
        "IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE": "**Integration_Strategy**: \n- Replace the standard self-attention block in the transformer encoder/decoder with the Nyström attention module.\n- Insert landmark selection (segment-means) at the start of each attention layer to generate \\( \\tilde{Q}, \\tilde{K} \\).\n- Compute the three attention matrices and pseudoinverse as described, then apply to values \\( V \\).\n- Add a skip connection with a 1D depthwise convolution over \\( V \\) to aid training stability.\n\n**Parameter_Settings**: \n- Number of landmarks \\( m \\): typically 32–128; set based on sequence length and available memory (e.g., \\( m = n/16 \\) or fixed).\n- Landmark selection: use simple segment means for efficiency and differentiability.\n- Pseudoinverse: 6–8 iterations of the Razavi et al. method suffice for convergence; initialize as described for stability.\n- All other transformer hyperparameters (heads, hidden size, etc.) remain standard.\n\n**Application_Conditions**: \n- Use when input sequences routinely exceed several hundred tokens, or when memory/computation constraints limit standard attention.\n- Especially beneficial for tasks requiring long-range dependency modeling (e.g., narrative completion, document-level QA, large-context extraction).\n- For short sequences (<256 tokens), standard attention may be marginally more accurate, but the efficiency gain is negligible.\n\n**Expected_Outcomes**: \n- Dramatic reduction in memory and compute for long sequences, enabling practical training/inference where standard transformers are infeasible.\n- Maintained or slightly improved performance on all core language modeling and reasoning tasks, especially for long-context benchmarks (e.g., lambada_openai, squad_completion).\n- Training loss curves remain smooth and comparable to full attention; convergence is not delayed by the approximation."
