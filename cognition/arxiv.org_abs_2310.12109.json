        "DESIGN_INSIGHT": "### DESIGN_INSIGHT_1: Sub-Quadratic, GEMM-Efficient Mixing via Monarch Matrices\n\nMonarch Mixer (M2) replaces both attention and MLP layers with a unified, expressive, sub-quadratic mixing primitive based on Monarch matrices—structured block-diagonal matrices interleaved with permutations. This enables efficient mixing along both sequence and model dimensions, reducing computational complexity from quadratic to O(N^{3/2}) or better, while maintaining or improving language modeling performance.",
        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures**: \n- Expect lower or equivalent training loss compared to Transformer baselines, especially at longer sequence lengths or higher model dimensions, due to improved hardware utilization and scaling.\n- Metrics sensitive to context and reasoning (lambada_openai, hellaswag, boolq, arc_easy/challenge, winogrande) should remain stable or improve, as M2 matches or exceeds BERT/GPT performance, while throughput (tokens/ms) increases dramatically for long sequences.\n- Structured extraction tasks (swde) and reading comprehension (squad_completion) should maintain baseline performance, as the mixing operator is expressive and general-purpose.\n\n**Architectural_Symptoms**: \n- Training and inference speedup becomes more pronounced as sequence length increases, with no degradation in task accuracy or reasoning metrics.",
