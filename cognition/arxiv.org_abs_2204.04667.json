        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures**: Models using standard RFA/Performer-style attention exhibit higher training loss and plateaued performance on tasks requiring nuanced context modeling (e.g., lambada_openai, hellaswag, squad_completion), even as the number of random features increases. Introducing query-adaptive (importance-weighted) random features, as in LARA, yields smoother loss curves and improved scores on tasks requiring long-range dependency and contextual reasoning (lambada_openai, hellaswag, winogrande, squad_completion), while also stabilizing training.\n\n**Architectural_Symptoms**: If the model’s attention approximation error does not decrease with more samples, or if performance on context/reasoning tasks lags behind softmax attention despite high feature counts, this signals bias introduced by input-agnostic random feature proposals.",

The philosophy is to test whether improved attention approximations can match or surpass exact softmax attention while enabling practical deployment on large-scale data.",
        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**: Reframe random feature attention (RFA/Performer) as a self-normalized importance sampling (SNIS) estimator of softmax attention, where the proposal distribution is typically input-agnostic (e.g., standard Gaussian). This reveals that RFA is a biased estimator of the *whole* softmax attention, not just the exponential kernel. To correct this, introduce query-dependent proposal distributions (as in RA), or, for efficiency, use multiple learned or structured proposals and combine them adaptively per query (as in LARA), thus reducing bias and improving fidelity.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**: The bias in RFA arises because the proposal distribution does not match the true, query-key-dependent mixture underlying softmax attention. By making the proposal distribution adaptive to query (either fully, as in RA, or partially, as in LARA), importance weights better reflect the actual attention landscape, reducing estimator bias and variance, and yielding more accurate attention maps.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**:  \n- Standard RFA estimates softmax attention as:  \n  \\[\n  \\text{RFA}(q_n, K, V) = \\frac{\\sum_s \\phi(q_n, \\omega_s)^T \\sum_m \\phi(k_m, \\omega_s) v_m}{\\sum_s \\phi(q_n, \\omega_s)^T \\sum_{m'} \\phi(k_{m'}, \\omega_s)}\n  \\]\n  where \\(\\omega_s \\sim N(0, I)\\), and \\(\\phi\\) is a positive random feature map.\n\n- The correct (unbiased) estimator (RA) samples \\(\\omega_s\\) from a query-specific mixture \\(p_n(\\omega)\\), and LARA generalizes this using multiple proposals \\(q_c(\\omega)\\) and query-adaptive weights \\(\\beta_{nc}(\\omega_c)\\):\n  \\[\n  \\text{LARA}(q_n, K, V) = \\frac{\\sum_c \\beta_{nc}(\\omega_c) \\tilde{p}_n(\\omega_c)/q_c(\\omega_c) f_n(\\omega_c)}{\\sum_c \\beta_{nc}(\\omega_c) \\tilde{p}_n(\\omega_c)/q_c(\\omega_c)}\n  \\]\n  where \\(f_n(\\omega)\\) is the attention-weighted value, and \\(\\tilde{p}_n(\\omega)\\) is the unnormalized query-dependent mixture.\n\n**Computational_Properties**:  \n- RA (fully query-adaptive) is unbiased but quadratic in sequence length (O(N²)), as key-value statistics cannot be reused across queries.\n- LARA (multi-proposal, partially adaptive) achieves linear complexity (O(N)), as proposals are shared and statistics can be reused, while still reducing bias compared to RFA.\n- Both approaches can be parallelized over proposals/samples, with LARA offering similar memory and runtime as Performer/RFA but with higher modeling fidelity.",
        "IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE": "**Integration_Strategy**:  \n- Replace standard self-attention modules' softmax or Performer-style attention with the LARA mechanism.\n- Insert multi-proposal random feature sampling and query-adaptive weighting in place of the usual random feature mapping.\n- Precompute key-value statistics per proposal (not per query), enabling computation reuse for linear scaling.\n\n**Parameter_Settings**:  \n- Number of proposals (C): Typically much smaller than sequence length N; trade off between expressiveness and efficiency.\n- Number of random features per proposal: As in Performer, but can be reduced due to improved sample efficiency.\n- Weighting function: Use a combination of query-agnostic and query-specific terms (e.g., normalized similarities between query and proposal subset representations).\n- Initialization: Proposals can be parameterized as mixtures or clusters over the query/key space; start with random or k-means centroids.\n\n**Application_Conditions**:  \n- Apply LARA when scaling to long sequences (N large) and when RFA/Performer shows poor convergence or underperforms on context/reasoning-heavy tasks despite increased feature count.\n- Use full RA only for small N or for ablation/reference purposes due to quadratic cost.\n\n**Expected_Outcomes**:  \n- Reduced training loss and improved convergence, especially on tasks requiring accurate context aggregation.\n- Significant gains on lambada_openai, hellaswag, winogrande, and squad_completion, with stable or improved performance on reasoning tasks (boolq, arc_easy/challenge, openbookqa).\n- Maintains or improves efficiency relative to Performer, enabling practical training on long sequences."

        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures**: LARA’s multi-proposal approach yields consistent improvements on tasks involving long-range dependencies (lambada_openai, hellaswag), narrative understanding (squad_completion), and commonsense (winogrande, piqa, social_iqa), while preserving or improving efficiency (training loss and runtime curves similar to Performer). Gains are especially pronounced as sequence length increases, with LARA outperforming both Performer and softmax attention on very long sequences.\n\n**Architectural_Symptoms**: When model performance on long-context tasks scales poorly with sequence length under standard linear attention, but improves with LARA, this indicates successful exploitation of multi-proposal adaptivity.",

        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**: Instead of using a single, fixed proposal for random feature sampling, LARA introduces multiple proposal distributions, each associated with a subset of queries. For each query, attention is estimated via multiple importance sampling (MIS), combining samples from each proposal using query-dependent weights that approximate the optimal variance-minimizing combination.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**: Sharing proposals across subsets of queries allows efficient reuse of key-value statistics (enabling linear complexity), while the adaptive weighting per query recovers much of the expressiveness of fully query-specific attention. This balances the trade-off between computational cost and attention map fidelity.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**:  \n- For C proposals \\(q_c(\\omega)\\), sample \\(\\omega_c \\sim q_c\\) for \\(c=1,...,C\\).\n- Compute per-query, per-proposal weights \\(\\beta_{nc}(\\omega_c)\\) (normalized across c), using both query-agnostic and query-specific similarity terms.\n- Final attention output for query n:\n  \\[\n  \\text{LARA}(q_n, K, V) = \\frac{\\sum_c \\beta_{nc}(\\omega_c) \\phi(q_n, \\omega_c)^T \\sum_m \\phi(k_m, \\omega_c) v_m}{\\sum_c \\beta_{nc}(\\omega_c) \\phi(q_n, \\omega_c)^T \\sum_{m'} \\phi(k_{m'}, \\omega_c)}\n  \\]\n\n**Computational_Properties**:  \n- Linear in sequence length (O(N)), as proposals are shared and statistics are precomputed per proposal.\n- Parallelizable over queries and proposals.\n- Marginally higher memory and computation than Performer, but much lower than full softmax or RA.\n- Sample efficiency is improved; fewer total random features are needed for similar or better accuracy.",
        "IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE": "**Integration_Strategy**:  \n- Implement a bank of proposal distributions (parameterized or learned) within each attention layer.\n- For each forward pass, sample random features from each proposal, precompute proposal-specific key-value statistics, and compute query-dependent weights for combining these proposals in the attention calculation.\n- Replace existing random feature mapping and aggregation logic with the MIS-based approach.\n\n**Parameter_Settings**:  \n- Number of proposals (C): Typically 4–16; more proposals increase expressiveness but also computation.\n- Proposal parameterization: Can be learned (e.g., via clustering or attention over query/key statistics), or fixed based on data partitioning.\n- Weighting function: Use efficient approximations (e.g., normalized similarities) to avoid intractable computation.\n\n**Application_Conditions**:  \n- Use LARA when long-sequence modeling is essential, or when softmax attention is infeasible due to memory/runtime constraints.\n- Prefer LARA over Performer when performance on long-context or narrative tasks is a priority, or when RFA’s approximation error plateaus with increased samples.\n\n**Expected_Outcomes**:  \n- Superior performance on context- and commonsense-heavy tasks (lambada_openai, hellaswag, squad_completion, winogrande) at scale.\n- Maintains or improves efficiency relative to Performer, enabling practical training and inference on long sequences.\n- Reduces variance and bias in attention approximation, leading to smoother training and better generalization."
