        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**: \nNSA replaces standard full attention with a three-branch sparse attention structure: (1) Coarse-grained token compression aggregates sequential blocks into compressed representations for global context, (2) Fine-grained blockwise token selection dynamically identifies and attends to the most relevant blocks using scores derived from the compression branch, and (3) A sliding window branch ensures local context is always preserved. All branches are combined via a learned gating mechanism.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**: \nBy aligning sparse computation with the natural blockwise continuity of attention scores and the hardware’s memory access patterns, NSA preserves both global and local information efficiently. The dynamic selection ensures critical information is retained, while blockwise operations maximize hardware throughput and minimize memory bottlenecks.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**: \n- For each query \\( q_t \\), construct compressed (\\( \\tilde{K}_{cmp}, \\tilde{V}_{cmp} \\)), selected (\\( \\tilde{K}_{slc}, \\tilde{V}_{slc} \\)), and window (\\( \\tilde{K}_{win}, \\tilde{V}_{win} \\)) key-value sets.\n- Attention output: \\( o^*_t = \\sum_{c \\in \\{cmp, slc, win\\}} g^c_t \\cdot Attn(q_t, \\tilde{K}^c_t, \\tilde{V}^c_t) \\), where \\( g^c_t \\) is a learned gate per branch.\n- Blockwise selection: Compute block importance from compression attention scores, select top-n blocks, concatenate their tokens for fine-grained attention.\n\n**Computational_Properties**: \n- Reduces attention complexity from quadratic to near-linear in sequence length.\n- Enables efficient parallelization via blockwise contiguous memory access (optimized for Tensor Cores/FlashAttention-like kernels).\n- Dramatically reduces memory bandwidth and compute requirements during both training and inference, especially at long sequence lengths.\n- End-to-end differentiable and natively trainable; no discrete or non-differentiable selection steps.",
        "IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE": "**Integration_Strategy**: \n- Replace standard attention modules in the transformer backbone with NSA modules.\n- Insert three parallel attention branches (compression, selection, window) in each attention layer; aggregate outputs with a learned gating MLP.\n- Ensure blockwise operations are aligned with hardware (e.g., keep block sizes and strides compatible with GPU memory coalescing and Tensor Core usage).\n\n**Parameter_Settings**: \n- Block size for compression (l): 16–64 tokens; stride (d) slightly less than block size to ensure overlap.\n- Selection block size (l′): 32–128 tokens; number of selected blocks (n): 8–32 (tune for memory/performance tradeoff).\n- Sliding window size (w): 256–1024 tokens, depending on expected locality.\n- Gate MLP: hidden size proportional to attention head size; sigmoid activation for gating.\n- All hyperparameters should be scaled with model size and expected sequence length.\n\n**Application_Conditions**: \n- Use NSA when training or deploying LLMs expected to handle sequences longer than 4k tokens, or when hardware efficiency is a bottleneck.\n- Especially beneficial for models serving document-level, codebase, or multi-turn conversational tasks (swde, squad_completion, lambada_openai, hellaswag).\n- For tasks dominated by short contexts, NSA can be used with minimal risk of degradation.\n\n**Expected_Outcomes**: \n- Substantial reduction in training and inference latency and memory usage as sequence length grows, with performance maintained or improved on both general and long-context benchmarks.\n- Enhanced ability to capture and reason over long-range dependencies, leading to higher scores on lambada_openai, squad_completion, arc_challenge, and related metrics.\n- Training loss curves should be at least as stable as Full Attention, with faster convergence on long-context data."
