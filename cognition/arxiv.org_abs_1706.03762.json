        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures**: \n- Dramatic improvement in tasks requiring long-range dependency modeling, as evidenced by higher lambada_openai and hellaswag scores, smoother and faster reduction in training loss, and increased winogrande performance due to better global context tracking.\n- Enhanced factual and commonsense reasoning (boolq, arc_easy/challenge, openbookqa, piqa, social_iqa) since all positions can interact directly, supporting complex relational inference.\n- Structured data extraction (swde) and reading comprehension (squad_completion) also benefit from direct and parallel context aggregation.\n- No observed degradation in few-shot adaptation (fda), with possible improvements due to more expressive representations.\n**Architectural_Symptoms**: \n- Training loss curves converge faster and more stably; attention visualization shows heads specializing in syntactic, semantic, and positional roles. Model scales efficiently with sequence length and model size.",

        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**: \n- Replace all recurrence and convolution with stacked layers of multi-head self-attention and position-wise feed-forward networks. Each position in a sequence attends to all others in parallel, with multiple attention heads learning diverse relational patterns.\n**Key_Mechanism**: \n- By allowing every token to interact with every other token in a constant number of sequential steps, the model eliminates path length bottlenecks and enables efficient, global context aggregation. Multi-head attention prevents representational bottlenecks and allows specialization.\n**Mathematical_Formulation**: \n- Scaled Dot-Product Attention:  \n  $$\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)V$$  \n- Multi-Head Attention:  \n  $$\\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \\text{Concat}(\\text{head}_1, ..., \\text{head}_h)W^O$$  \n  $$\\text{head}_i = \\text{Attention}(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V)$$  \n- Feed-Forward:  \n  $$\\text{FFN}(x) = \\max(0, xW_1 + b_1)W_2 + b_2$$  \n**Computational_Properties**: \n- Per-layer complexity $O(n^2 d)$ (where $n$ is sequence length, $d$ is representation size), but fully parallelizable across sequence positions and attention heads. Memory usage scales quadratically with sequence length. No sequential dependency, enabling efficient hardware utilization and reduced wall-clock training time.",
        "IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE": "**Integration_Strategy**: \n- Replace RNN or CNN layers in encoder and decoder stacks with alternating multi-head self-attention and feed-forward layers. Maintain residual connections and layer normalization after each sub-layer.\n**Parameter_Settings**: \n- Number of heads ($h$): 8 (base), 16 (large); head dimension $d_k = d_v = d_{\\text{model}}/h$ for balanced computation. Feed-forward inner dimension $d_{ff} = 4 \\times d_{\\text{model}}$. Use dropout after each sub-layer and on embeddings.\n**Application_Conditions**: \n- Apply when training on tasks requiring global context, long-range dependencies, or parallelizable computation. Particularly beneficial for language modeling, translation, reading comprehension, and QA tasks.\n**Expected_Outcomes**: \n- Expect significant gains in context-dependent metrics (lambada_openai, hellaswag, winogrande, squad_completion), faster and more stable convergence (training loss), and robust generalization across factual and commonsense QA benchmarks. Training wall-clock time decreases substantially compared to RNN/CNN architectures."

Can choose between fixed (sinusoidal) or learned embeddings; both achieve similar results.\n**Parameter_Settings**: \n- Use $d_{\\text{model}}$-dimensional encodings; for sinusoidal, follow geometric progression of wavelengths. No additional hyperparameters required for fixed encodings.\n**Application_Conditions**: \n- Essential when using attention-only architectures for any task where order matters (most language modeling, QA, and sequence transduction tasks). Fixed encodings recommended if extrapolation to longer sequences is needed.\n**Expected_Outcomes**: \n- Maintains or improves order-sensitive metric performance (lambada_openai, squad_completion, arc_easy/challenge), allows model to generalize to longer sequences, and preserves full parallelization."
