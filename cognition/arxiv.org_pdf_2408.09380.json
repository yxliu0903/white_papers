        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures**: \n- Models using this mechanism will show notably improved training loss curves, especially on long input sequences, due to the linear (O(Nk)) rather than quadratic (O(N²)) attention computation. This leads to faster convergence and reduced GPU/memory usage.\n- On tasks requiring long-range dependency modeling (e.g., lambada_openai, hellaswag, squad_completion), expect stable or improved performance relative to baseline Transformers, particularly as sequence length increases.\n- For tasks that stress efficiency or require very long context windows (e.g., swde, fda), expect substantial gains in throughput and memory efficiency without a drop in accuracy.\n**Architectural_Symptoms**: \n- Training logs will show both lower memory consumption and reduced wall-clock time per step as sequence length increases, with no collapse in context-sensitive metrics.",

The self-attention in Transformers computes pairwise token interactions, allowing effective modeling of long-range dependencies in user behavior sequences. However, this mechanism incurs quadratic computational and memory costs as sequence lengths increase, limiting scalability for very long user histories.\n\n**Technical Limitations**: Traditional self-attention's O(N²) complexity (with N as sequence length) makes it impractical for modeling long-term behavior due to excessive memory and computation demands.

        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**: \n- Replace standard self-attention with a two-stage Linear Dispatcher Attention (LDA): (1) a small set of learnable “interest tokens” (k ≪ N) aggregate information from the input sequence via cross-attention, then (2) the compressed interest tokens redistribute their context back to all sequence positions, again via cross-attention.\n- Both aggregation and redistribution are performed with cross-attention, but with complexity O(Nk) per layer, decoupling sequence length from computational bottlenecks.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**: \n- By compressing sequence information into a fixed, small set of learnable tokens, the model preserves global context and interaction patterns while avoiding the quadratic explosion of pairwise attention. This allows efficient scaling to very long sequences without sacrificing the ability to model dependencies.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**: \n- Aggregation: \\( P^{i+1} = \\text{Softmax}(P^i W_{Q1} (X^i W_{K1})^T / \\sqrt{d}) X^i W_{V1} \\), where \\( P^i \\) are k interest tokens, \\( X^i \\) is the sequence.\n- Distribution: \\( X^{i+1} = \\text{Softmax}(X^i W_{Q2} (P^{i+1} W_{K2})^T / \\sqrt{d}) P^{i+1} W_{V2} \\).\n- Total complexity per layer: O(Nk).\n\n**Computational_Properties**: \n- Linear in sequence length (O(Nk)), highly parallelizable (matrix multiplications), and reduces peak memory usage by up to 90% for long sequences.\n- Allows larger batch sizes or longer context windows for the same hardware footprint.",
        "IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE": "**Integration_Strategy**: \n- Replace standard self-attention blocks in the Transformer encoder/decoder with the two-stage LDA block.\n- Insert learnable interest token embeddings at each LDA layer; these act as bottlenecks for information flow.\n- Maintain residual and feedforward layers as in standard architectures.\n\n**Parameter_Settings**: \n- Number of interest tokens (k): typically 8–32; set much less than sequence length N.\n- Head count: standard multi-head settings (e.g., 4–16), but increasing heads beyond a certain point yields diminishing returns.\n- Initialization: interest tokens should be initialized randomly and learned end-to-end.\n\n**Application_Conditions**: \n- Most beneficial when input sequences are long (hundreds to thousands of tokens), or when memory/throughput is a bottleneck.\n- If model shows quadratic scaling in memory or latency as sequence length increases, or if long-range tasks degrade, this technique is indicated.\n\n**Expected_Outcomes**: \n- Significant reduction in training/inference time and memory usage for long sequences, with stable or improved performance on tasks requiring long-range context (lambada_openai, hellaswag, squad_completion, swde).\n- Enables training with longer context windows without hardware upgrades."
