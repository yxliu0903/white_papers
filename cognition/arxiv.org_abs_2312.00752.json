        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures**:  \n- Models with selective (input-dependent) SSM parameters show markedly improved performance on tasks requiring content-sensitive context modeling and reasoning, such as lambada_openai (narrative cloze), hellaswag (commonsense sentence completion), winogrande (pronoun resolution), and arc_easy/challenge (science QA), while also reducing training loss more efficiently.  \n- Gains are particularly strong on tasks where the relevant context is non-local or interspersed with irrelevant information, as the model can learn to filter and compress only salient input into its state (e.g., lambada_openai, squad_completion, winogrande).  \n- Unlike LTI SSMs, performance improves monotonically with longer context (sequence length), especially on tasks like lambada_openai and DNA modeling, rather than plateauing or degrading.\n\n**Architectural_Symptoms**:  \n- Training curves show smoother, faster loss reduction and better scaling with increased sequence length; ablation of the selection mechanism leads to sharp drops in context-sensitive benchmarks and less improvement with longer context.",

        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**:  \n- The SSM parameters that determine information flow along the sequence‚Äîspecifically Œî (discretization/gating), ùë© (input projection), and ùë™ (output projection)‚Äîare made functions of the current input token (i.e., ùë†Œî(ùë•), ùë†ùêµ(ùë•), ùë†ùê∂(ùë•)), producing time-varying, content-dependent dynamics.  \n- This enables the model to selectively propagate, forget, or reset information at each timestep based on token content, rather than using fixed, time-invariant recurrence or convolution.  \n- Mechanistically, this generalizes RNN gating to high-dimensional, structured SSMs, allowing explicit content-based selection for each token.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**:  \n- The fundamental insight is that context compression in sequence models must be selective‚Äîable to filter out irrelevant information and focus on salient content. Making SSM parameters input-dependent gives the model direct, fine-grained control over what information is remembered or discarded at each step, addressing the core limitation of LTI (time-invariant) SSMs and enabling content-based reasoning comparable to attention.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**:  \n- For each timestep t,  \n  - ùë©‚Çú = Linear_N(ùë•‚Çú), ùë™‚Çú = Linear_N(ùë•‚Çú), Œî‚Çú = œÑ_Œî (Parameter + Linear_1(ùë•‚Çú))  \n  - Recurrence: ‚Ñé‚Çú = ùë®‚Ñé‚Çú‚Çã‚ÇÅ + ùë©‚Çúùë•‚Çú  \n  - Output: ùë¶‚Çú = ùë™‚Çú‚Ñé‚Çú  \n  - Œî controls how much to reset or persist state (analogous to a gate: large Œî ‚Üí reset, small Œî ‚Üí persist).\n\n**Computational_Properties**:  \n- Time and memory complexity remain linear in sequence length (O(BLDN)), but convolutional parallelization is lost; computation is performed via a parallel scan (hardware-efficient recurrence) with kernel fusion and recomputation to minimize memory overhead.  \n- Training and inference are efficient; no need to cache full sequence history (as in attention), enabling constant-time autoregressive inference per token and high throughput.",
        "IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE": "**Integration_Strategy**:  \n- Replace standard SSM or attention layers with selective SSM layers: parameterize Œî, ùë©, ùë™ as small neural networks (typically linear projections) of the input at each timestep.  \n- Insert the selective SSM layer as the main sequence modeling block, optionally combined with normalization and residual connections; can fully replace attention and MLP blocks as in Mamba, or be hybridized.\n\n**Parameter_Settings**:  \n- The projection dimension for Œî can be as small as 1 (broadcasted to channels) or a small fraction of the model dimension; increasing projection size or SSM state dimension N improves expressivity with modest parameter cost.  \n- Use real-valued SSMs for discrete modalities (text, DNA); complex-valued for continuous signals (audio).  \n- Initialization: S4D-Real or random initialization for ùë®; Œî initialized from Uniform([0.001, 0.1]) after inverse softplus.\n\n**Application_Conditions**:  \n- Apply when model performance on context-sensitive or reasoning tasks (lambada_openai, hellaswag, winogrande, arc_easy/challenge) plateaus with longer context, or when LTI SSM/convolutional models underperform on discrete, information-dense data.  \n- Particularly beneficial for long-context language modeling, genomics, and tasks with noisy or variable-length context dependencies.\n\n**Expected_Outcomes**:  \n- Significant improvement in content-based reasoning, long-range dependency tracking, and context compression‚Äîobservable as higher scores on lambada_openai, hellaswag, winogrande, arc_easy/challenge, and squad_completion, with smoother and lower training loss.  \n- Linear scaling in sequence length and much higher inference throughput compared to Transformers, especially as context increases.  \n- Performance improves monotonically with context length, unlike LTI SSM or convolutional models."
