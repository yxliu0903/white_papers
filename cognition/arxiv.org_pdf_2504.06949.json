        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures**: Training loss curves remain unchanged (or nearly identical) compared to baseline FoX, while training throughput and FLOP efficiency increase significantly—especially at longer context lengths. Downstream metrics (lambada_openai, hellaswag, winogrande, arc_easy/challenge, boolq, piqa, etc.) show no degradation and may exhibit minor fluctuations within run-to-run variance. No drop in long-context or retrieval performance (lambada_openai, squad_completion, needle-in-a-haystack).\n\n**Architectural_Symptoms**: Attention heads become differentiated into “local” (heavily pruned, focusing on short-range dependencies) and “global” (unpruned, maintaining long-range context), visible in per-head FLOP savings distributions and attention maps.",
        "BACKGROUND": "**Title**: Adaptive Computation Pruning for the Forgetting Transformer\n\n**Historical Technical Context**: Before this work, sequence modeling was dominated by architectures like LSTMs, which used gating to control memory, and Transformers, which employed multi-head self-attention with quadratic complexity in sequence length. The standard Transformer computes dense attention over all tokens, often using techniques like Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) for positional encoding and FlashAttention for efficient memory usage. Recent innovations, such as the Forgetting Transformer (FoX), introduced a forget gate into attention, allowing selective downweighting of distant context.\n\n**Technical Limitations**: Traditional Transformers expend significant computation on weak or negligible long-range dependencies, especially over long contexts, leading to inefficiency.

        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**: Introduce a dynamic, per-head, per-sequence pruning mechanism for attention computations in the Forgetting Transformer (FoX). At each forward pass, the forget gate produces a decay bias matrix D; blocks of attention computation where the decay bias falls below a dynamically computed threshold δ are pruned entirely (i.e., their contributions are skipped), ensuring that the sum of pruned attention weights is bounded by a small ε.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**: By leveraging the monotonic decay structure introduced by the forget gate, ACP identifies regions of the attention matrix whose influence is mathematically guaranteed to be negligible. The dynamic threshold δ is computed using an upper bound of attention logits, context length, and a user-specified ε, making pruning both safe (no meaningful information loss) and adaptive to input, model state, and head specialization.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**:\n- Decay bias: \\( D_{ij} = \\sum_{l=j+1}^i \\log f_l \\), where \\( f_l \\) is the forget gate output.\n- Pruning threshold: \\( \\delta = -2U - \\log L + \\log \\epsilon \\), with \\( U \\) an upper bound on attention logits and \\( L \\) the context length.\n- Pruned attention: Only compute terms where \\( D_{ij} \\geq \\delta \\); all others are skipped.\n- Block-level pruning: A block is pruned if its top-right decay bias entry \\( D_{max} \\) is below \\( \\delta \\).\n\n**Computational_Properties**: Reduces softmax attention FLOPs by ~70% (empirically), with greater savings at longer context lengths. The pruning boundary is found in linear time per sequence. Pruning is performed at block granularity, fully compatible with FlashAttention-style kernels and parallel GPU execution. No additional memory overhead; may reduce memory traffic at inference time if used for KV-cache eviction.",
        "IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE": "**Integration_Strategy**: \n- Requires the Forgetting Transformer (FoX) as the attention mechanism (i.e., with per-head forget gates producing decay bias matrices).\n- Modify the attention kernel (e.g., FlashAttention) to compute the decay bias D and, for each query block, determine the rightmost block to keep (pruning boundary).\n- Only process attention blocks above the pruning boundary during both forward and backward passes.\n\n**Parameter_Settings**:\n- ε: Controls maximum total pruned attention weight per query (default \\( e^{-10} \\); can be larger for more aggressive pruning).\n- U: Upper bound on attention logits (can be computed from QK-norm scaling parameters or estimated from data).\n- Block size: Should match or be a multiple of hardware-friendly sizes (e.g., FlashAttention block sizes).\n- No need to tune per-head or per-layer thresholds; all are derived dynamically.\n\n**Application_Conditions**:\n- Use when employing FoX or any attention with monotonic, learnable decay (forget gates).\n- Especially beneficial for long context lengths and large models, or when throughput is a bottleneck.\n- Not applicable to standard softmax attention without decay/forget gates.\n\n**Expected_Outcomes**:\n- Dramatic speed-up in attention computation and overall training throughput with no loss in language modeling or downstream task performance.\n- No degradation in long-range dependency modeling (lambada_openai, squad_completion, needle-in-a-haystack), factual reasoning (arc_easy/challenge, boolq, openbookqa), or commonsense (piqa, social_iqa, hellaswag).\n- Training loss curves and downstream metrics remain stable; computational savings scale with context length."

        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures**: Models maintain or slightly improve performance on both short-context (winogrande, piqa, boolq) and long-context (lambada_openai, squad_completion) tasks. Analysis of per-head FLOP savings reveals a bimodal distribution: most heads are heavily pruned (“local”), while a minority remain unpruned (“global”), supporting both local and global dependency modeling without explicit architectural partitioning.\n\n**Architectural_Symptoms**: Visualization of attention weights and decay matrices shows some heads focusing only on recent tokens (local), while others attend broadly (global). This specialization is stable across layers, with lower layers skewed toward locality.",

        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**: The combination of forget gates in FoX and ACP’s dynamic pruning induces head-wise specialization. Heads with strong forget (high decay) become local, pruning most distant dependencies, while heads with weak forget remain global. No explicit architectural constraint or regularization is needed—specialization emerges from the interplay of the forget gate and data-driven pruning.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**: The learnable forget gate enables each head to adapt its effective receptive field during training, with ACP amplifying this by removing computations for negligible dependencies. This allows efficient allocation of computation: most heads focus on local context (critical for syntax, short-range reasoning), while a few maintain global context (needed for discourse, long-range retrieval).\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**:\n- For each head, the effective attention span is determined by the decay bias D and the pruning threshold δ.\n- The distribution of pruned FLOPs per head is bimodal, with heads clustering at either high or low pruning rates.\n- No explicit loss or regularization term is needed; specialization arises from optimization dynamics.\n\n**Computational_Properties**: Allows the model to scale to longer contexts without quadratic cost, as most heads’ computation scales sub-quadratically (local heads) while only a few heads pay the full cost (global heads). This enables efficient use of compute and memory, especially in deep models.",
        "IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE": "**Integration_Strategy**:\n- No need for explicit architectural partitioning of heads; simply train FoX with ACP and allow specialization to emerge.\n- Optionally, monitor per-head pruning rates and attention maps for interpretability or further optimization.\n\n**Parameter_Settings**:\n- No head-specific hyperparameters; all heads share the same pruning threshold logic.\n- If desired, regularization or curriculum could be added to encourage more/less locality, but not required for strong results.\n\n**Application_Conditions**:\n- Use in any scenario where both local (syntax, entity resolution) and global (retrieval, long-range reasoning) dependencies are important.\n- Particularly valuable in long-context LLMs or memory-efficient deployment.\n\n**Expected_Outcomes**:\n- Maintains or improves performance across both short- and long-context tasks (winogrande, lambada_openai, squad_completion, arc_easy/challenge).\n- Model automatically allocates computation where needed, yielding efficient and robust language modeling.\n- Enables interpretability of attention head roles and potential for targeted pruning or specialization in future work."
