        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**: Replace standard full self-attention (O(L²)) with efficient attention variants:\n- Local/block attention: restrict each token to attend to a local window or block.\n- Hierarchical attention: introduce multi-level attention (e.g., sentence-level then document-level).\n- Sparse attention: use learnable or fixed sparse masks (e.g., strided, dilated, random, or graph-based patterns).\n- Approximated attention: linearize attention via low-rank projections, kernel tricks, or randomized feature maps.\n- IO-aware attention: optimize memory access (e.g., FlashAttention, SCFA) to speed up exact attention with minimal memory overhead.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**: By limiting the number of tokens each position attends to (or approximating the attention computation), the architecture reduces computational and memory costs from quadratic to linear or near-linear, enabling practical training and inference on long sequences.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**:\n- Local attention: For each token i, restrict attention to j ∈ [i-w, i] (window size w), so A ∈ ℝ^{L×w} instead of ℝ^{L×L}.\n- Sparse attention: Mask M_S with |S_i| ≪ L nonzero entries per row.\n- Approximated attention: O = φ(Q) [φ(K)^T V] / [φ(Q) φ(K)^T 1_L], with φ(·) a kernel mapping.\n- IO-aware: Partition Q, K, V into blocks and process on-chip to minimize HBM access.\n\n**Computational_Properties**: Time/space complexity reduced to O(Ld), O(L√L d), or O(L log L d) depending on method. High parallelization potential, especially for block/sparse/approximated and IO-aware variants. Enables training and inference with much longer context windows without OOM or prohibitive slowdowns.",

For IO-aware methods (FlashAttention, SCFA), swap in optimized CUDA kernels at the attention computation step.\n\n**Parameter_Settings**: \n- Local window/block size: typically 128–1024 tokens.\n- Sparsity patterns: stride ≈ √L, window size w, number of global tokens, or clustering parameters.\n- Approximation rank (k): O(d/ε²) for low-rank; kernel feature dimension r ≈ 64–256.\n- For IO-aware: block size set to maximize on-chip SRAM utilization.\n\n**Application_Conditions**: Apply when observed training/inference memory or runtime scales poorly with context length, or when performance on long-context tasks (lambada_openai, squad_completion, hellaswag) degrades sharply as sequence length increases.\n\n**Expected_Outcomes**: \n- Ability to scale LLMs to much longer input sequences with no or minimal loss in modeling power.\n- Training loss remains stable as context grows.\n- Significant improvements in long-context benchmarks (lambada_openai, squad_completion).\n- No loss in short-context or reasoning tasks, and potential gains in tasks requiring long-range context integration."
