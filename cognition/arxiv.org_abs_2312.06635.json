        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures**: This innovation will manifest as faster training (lower wall-clock time per step) and smoother, more stable training loss curves, especially for long sequences (2K-20K tokens). It enables efficient scaling to long contexts without memory bottlenecks, so tasks requiring long-range context—such as lambada_openai, squad_completion, and swde—will see improved or at least stable performance at much lower compute cost. Efficiency improvements may also allow for larger batch sizes or model dimensions, indirectly boosting performance on all metrics by enabling more effective training.\n\n**Architectural_Symptoms**: Memory usage per token remains linear (not quadratic) in sequence length, and throughput does not degrade sharply as sequence length increases. Training loss curves are less noisy and converge faster for long-sequence regimes.",

        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**: FLASHLINEARATTENTION implements linear attention using a chunkwise parallel form, dividing sequences into fixed-size chunks (parameter C). Inter-chunk computations are performed sequentially (recurrent), while intra-chunk computations are done in parallel (matrix-multiply), enabling use of GPU tensor cores. Two modes are offered: (a) materialize chunk states in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) for maximum parallelism, or (b) recompute chunk states on-the-fly for minimal memory usage. I/O-aware tiling and on-chip SRAM reuse minimize data movement and maximize hardware utilization.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**: By chunking and tiling both the sequence and memory access patterns, the algorithm aligns computation with hardware memory hierarchies and specialized units (tensor cores), eliminating the typical I/O bottlenecks of naïve linear attention implementations. This enables true linear scaling in both compute and memory without sacrificing parallelism.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**:\n- For each chunk:\n    - Inter-chunk: \\( S[i+1] = S[i] + K[i+1]^T V[i+1] \\)\n    - Intra-chunk: \\( O[i+1] = Q[i+1] S[i] + (Q[i+1] K[i+1]^T \\odot M) V[i+1] \\)\n    - Where \\( S \\) is the hidden state, \\( K, Q, V \\) are chunked key/query/value matrices, and \\( M \\) is the causal mask.\n\n**Computational_Properties**: \n- Time complexity: \\( O(L d^2 + L C d) \\) (sub-quadratic, near-linear for reasonable C)\n- Space complexity: linear in sequence length\n- Highly parallelizable within chunks, with optional sequence-level parallelism via materialization\n- Optimal for hardware with large on-chip SRAM and tensor cores; batch size or chunk size can be tuned to match hardware",
