This enables both efficient hardware utilization and the scaling of fast-weight state size (up to 40% of model parameters), allowing the model to store richer context and handle very long sequences with high throughput. The approach is modality-agnostic and supports diverse data structures (1D, sets, N-D grids).",
        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures:**  \n- Substantial improvements in metrics sensitive to long-range dependencies (e.g., lambada_openai, hellaswag, squad_completion) due to enhanced context memory and reduced information bottleneck.\n- Smoother and faster decrease in training loss, especially for long-sequence tasks, reflecting better hardware utilization and faster convergence.\n- For structured data extraction (swde) and reading comprehension (squad_completion), expect improved performance due to the model's ability to maintain and retrieve context over longer spans.\n- Metrics focused on local reasoning (piqa, social_iqa, openbookqa) remain stable or slightly improved due to the hybrid use of window attention for locality.\n\n**Architectural_Symptoms:**  \nTraining logs will show much higher GPU utilization and throughput, with validation loss curves flattening less at large sequence positions, indicating effective use of long context.",
