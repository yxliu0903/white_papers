        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures**: Linear attention enables efficient processing of much longer sequences, resulting in smoother training loss curves and faster convergence for tasks with long contexts. Expect similar or slightly reduced performance on context-heavy tasks (lambada_openai, hellaswag, squad_completion) compared to standard transformers, but with dramatically improved memory and speed. For tasks requiring long-range dependencies (lambada_openai, winogrande), performance remains competitive, while throughput and efficiency are vastly improved. Structured extraction (swde) and data augmentation (fda) tasks benefit from the ability to handle larger contexts without memory bottlenecks.\n\n**Architectural_Symptoms**: Training and inference memory usage grows linearly with sequence length; GPU utilization remains high even for long inputs; inference latency per token is constant, not increasing with context length.",
        "BACKGROUND": "**Title**: Transformers are RNNs: Fast Autoregressive Transformers with Linear Attention\n\n**Historical Technical Context**: Prior to this work, dominant sequence modeling architectures included recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and Transformers. RNNs and LSTMs processed input sequentially, maintaining hidden states, while Transformers used self-attention to capture global dependencies in parallel, but with quadratic time and memory complexity in sequence length. Early efficient Transformer variants attempted to reduce this cost via sparse or approximate attention mechanisms, but still faced scaling and inference speed issues for long sequences.\n\n**Technical Limitations**: Traditional Transformers' self-attention requires O(N²) computation and memory, making them slow and impractical for long sequences or real-time autoregressive inference.

These limitations hindered the ability to model very long contexts efficiently and limited practical deployment in resource-constrained settings.\n\n**Paper Concepts**: - **Linear Attention:** Reformulates self-attention as a dot-product of kernel feature maps, reducing complexity from O(N²) to O(N) by exploiting associativity in matrix multiplication.\n- **Kernel Feature Map (ϕ):** A function ϕ(x) transforming input vectors to a higher-dimensional space such that attention weights can be computed as ϕ(Q)·ϕ(K)ᵗ.\n- **Causal Masking:** Restricts attention so each position attends only to previous or current positions, enabling autoregressive modeling.\n- **Autoregressive Inference:** Sequentially generates outputs, where each prediction depends on all previous outputs, typically requiring efficient state updates.\n\n**Experimental Context**: The paper evaluates models on tasks involving sequence generation, such as language or image modeling, and on sequence classification tasks like speech recognition.

        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**: Replace the standard softmax-based attention with a kernel-based linear attention mechanism. Compute attention using a feature map φ(x) (e.g., φ(x) = elu(x) + 1), allowing the attention output to be written as a ratio of dot products between feature-mapped queries and keys. Exploit associativity to incrementally compute cumulative key-value and key sums, enabling both forward and backward passes in O(N) time and memory.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**: By mapping queries and keys into a feature space where the attention can be expressed as linear dot products, the computation avoids the quadratic scaling of the attention matrix. The associativity of matrix multiplication allows efficient incremental updates, making both training and autoregressive inference scalable to very long sequences.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**:\n- Attention output for position i:  \n  \\( V'_i = \\frac{\\phi(Q_i)^T \\sum_{j=1}^N \\phi(K_j) V_j^T}{\\phi(Q_i)^T \\sum_{j=1}^N \\phi(K_j)} \\)\n- For causal masking (autoregressive):  \n  \\( S_i = S_{i-1} + \\phi(K_i) V_i^T \\),  \n  \\( Z_i = Z_{i-1} + \\phi(K_i) \\),  \n  \\( V'_i = \\frac{\\phi(Q_i)^T S_i}{\\phi(Q_i)^T Z_i} \\)\n\n**Computational_Properties**:  \n- Time/space complexity: O(NDM) for sequence length N, feature dimension D, value dimension M  \n- Fully parallelizable during training (like standard transformers); constant-time per-step inference (like RNNs)  \n- Memory access is sequential for causal masking, but requires only storing cumulative sums, not the entire attention matrix  \n- Dramatic reduction in memory usage allows much longer context windows without hardware bottlenecks",
        "IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE": "**Integration_Strategy**:  \n- Replace the self-attention module in each transformer block with the linear attention formulation  \n- Insert feature mapping φ(·) after the query and key projections  \n- For autoregressive tasks, implement cumulative sum buffers for key-value and key-only accumulators; update these at each step  \n- Ensure gradient computation uses the linear-time, constant-memory algorithm for backpropagation\n\n**Parameter_Settings**:  \n- Choose feature map φ(·) to ensure non-negativity (e.g., elu(x) + 1 or similar)  \n- Feature dimension C should be set ≥ hidden size D for good approximation; can be tuned for a tradeoff between accuracy and speed  \n- Initialization and optimizer settings remain similar to standard transformers; no special changes required\n\n**Application_Conditions**:  \n- Most beneficial when sequence lengths are large (N ≫ D), or when inference latency and memory are critical bottlenecks  \n- Use for tasks where context size exceeds practical limits of quadratic attention (e.g., document-level QA, long-form generation, structured extraction)  \n- For tasks where exact softmax attention is critical for peak accuracy, validate that linear attention does not degrade key metrics\n\n**Expected_Outcomes**:  \n- Enables processing of much longer sequences with minimal hardware cost  \n- Training loss curves become smoother for long sequences due to lack of memory-related truncation  \n- Comparable or slightly reduced performance on context-heavy tasks (lambada_openai, squad_completion), but with dramatically higher throughput and efficiency  \n- Inference for autoregressive tasks becomes orders of magnitude faster; practical for real-time or resource-constrained deployment"
