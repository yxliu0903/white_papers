        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures**: Models with BASED’s hybrid attention should show (a) strong improvements in recall-demanding tasks such as squad_completion, swde, fda, and lambada_openai, matching or exceeding attention-free models (Mamba, Hyena) while approaching or matching full attention on recall. General language modeling loss (training loss) and perplexity should remain competitive with standard attention for the same parameter budget. Tasks focused on local context (winogrande, hellaswag, piqa, social_iqa) should maintain stable or slightly improved scores due to better local modeling. The throughput gains will manifest as much faster generation (especially for long sequences) and smoother, lower training loss curves due to improved memory efficiency.\n\n**Architectural_Symptoms**: You will observe that increasing the sliding window size or linear attention feature dimension in BASED leads to monotonic improvements in recall metrics (e.g., squad_completion, swde, lambada_openai) at the cost of increased recurrent state size, but with throughput and memory usage still far below full attention.",
        "BACKGROUND": "**Title**: Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput tradeoff\n\n**Historical Technical Context**: Prior to this work, dominant language model architectures included Transformers with softmax attention, which compute token interactions using a quadratic-time attention mechanism, and recurrent alternatives like RNNs, LSTMs, and state-space models (SSMs) that maintain a fixed-size state but often struggle with long-range dependencies. Sparse or sliding-window attention and linear attention variants were developed to improve efficiency, but typically sacrificed recall or modeling power. Recent efficient architectures such as Mamba and Hyena attempted to match attention's quality with sub-quadratic computation by using gated convolutions or input-dependent recurrence.\n\n**Technical Limitations**: Traditional attention mechanisms require a key-value (KV) cache that grows linearly with sequence length, causing high memory usage and low throughput during inference. Efficient alternatives with fixed-size state (e.g., SSMs, gated convolutions, linear attention) improve speed and memory but suffer degraded recall, especially on tasks needing precise access to long-range context. This creates a fundamental tradeoff between recall capacity and inference efficiency that prior models could not flexibly navigate.\n\n**Paper Concepts**: - **Recall**: The ability of a model to accurately use information from earlier tokens in a sequence during generation.\n- **Linear Attention**: An attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with kernel feature maps ϕ(·), enabling computation and memory scaling sub-quadratically with sequence length.\n- **Sliding Window Attention (SWA)**: Attention restricted to a local window of recent tokens of fixed width w, reducing memory to O(w) but limiting long-range recall.\n- **BASED Architecture**: A hybrid model combining global linear attention (using a Taylor-approximated feature map) and local sliding window attention, allowing tunable tradeoffs between memory use and recall.\n- **IO-aware Algorithm**: Hardware-optimized implementations minimizing memory movement (IO) to maximize throughput, especially for linear attention on GPUs.\n\n**Experimental Context**: Models are evaluated on language modeling tasks requiring both general next-token prediction and strong recall of earlier context, including tasks like reading comprehension, information extraction, and in-context question answering. Evaluation emphasizes both overall generation quality (perplexity, accuracy) and efficiency metrics (throughput, memory use), with special focus on recall-intensive settings. The experimental philosophy stresses real-world, long-context tasks and efficiency under practical hardware constraints.",
        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**: BASED interleaves two attention mechanisms per layer (or via layer mixing): (1) global linear attention using a softmax-approximating feature map (e.g., 2nd-order Taylor expansion), and (2) exact softmax attention restricted to a small sliding window (e.g., 64–128 tokens). The outputs are combined (e.g., via concatenation or addition), allowing the model to capture both long-range dependencies (via linear attention) and precise local shifts/comparisons (via windowed attention), with the tradeoff adjustable via window size and feature dimension.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**: This works because global linear attention provides cheap, fixed-size memory access to all prior tokens (enabling long-range recall), while local sliding window attention preserves the high-precision, high-fidelity local token interaction that linear attention alone lacks. The combination allows the model to smoothly traverse the recall-throughput Pareto frontier by adjusting hyperparameters.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**:\n- **Linear attention** (with feature map ϕ):\n  - yᵢ = (ϕ(qᵢ)ᵗ ∑_{j=1}^i ϕ(kⱼ) vⱼ) / (ϕ(qᵢ)ᵗ ∑_{j=1}^i ϕ(kⱼ))\n  - ϕ(q), ϕ(k) ≈ exp(qᵗk) via Taylor or other kernel.\n- **Sliding window attention**:\n  - yᵢ = softmax(qᵢ K_{i-w+1:i}) V_{i-w+1:i}\n- **Hybrid output**: yᵢ = f(linear_attention(qᵢ, K, V), sliding_window_attention(qᵢ, K, V)), with f typically being addition or concatenation.\n\n**Computational_Properties**:\n- Time/space: O(Nd²) for linear attention; O(Nwd) for sliding window (w ≪ N).\n- Recurrent state: Fixed-size for linear attention (set by feature dimension), window-size for sliding window.\n- Highly parallelizable; windowed attention leverages GPU tensor cores efficiently at small window sizes.\n- Training and inference are both sub-quadratic in sequence length; memory usage is tunable and can be much lower than full attention.",
        "IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE": "**Integration_Strategy**: Replace or augment standard transformer attention layers with a hybrid module: for each layer, compute both global linear attention (using a Taylor or similar feature map) and local sliding window softmax attention, then combine the results (add or concatenate, then project). Tune the ratio of linear/sliding window/gated convolution layers as needed (e.g., 20% linear, 20% sliding window, 60% convolution).\n\n**Parameter_Settings**:\n- Sliding window size: 64–128 tokens (hardware-aware, fits well with GPU tensor cores).\n- Linear attention feature dimension: 16–32 (projected from model dimension); higher increases recall at the cost of memory.\n- Taylor feature map order: 2nd order is a strong default.\n- Adjust the number of each layer type to balance throughput and recall needs.\n\n**Application_Conditions**: Use this design when you need high throughput and memory efficiency but cannot sacrifice recall on long-context or in-context learning tasks (e.g., document QA, information extraction, summarization, code generation). Especially beneficial when standard attention’s KV-cache is a bottleneck.\n\n**Expected_Outcomes**: Expect strong recall on tasks like squad_completion, swde, fda, and lambada_openai, with training loss and general language modeling metrics matching or slightly trailing full attention. Throughput and memory usage will be much improved over standard attention, especially for long sequences, without the severe recall drop-off of pure linear or convolutional models."

        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures**: The use of IO-aware kernels will not directly alter language modeling accuracy metrics, but will manifest as significantly improved throughput (tokens/sec) and reduced latency for both prefill and generation steps, especially at large batch sizes and long sequence lengths. Training loss curves may descend more smoothly due to higher data throughput and reduced stalls. Models can be trained and deployed with larger batch sizes or longer contexts without running out of memory.\n\n**Architectural_Symptoms**: Profiling will show reduced memory bandwidth usage, higher tensor core utilization, and lower wall-clock times for forward and generation passes, especially for the linear attention and sliding window modules.",

        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**: The paper introduces custom CUDA kernels that fuse feature map computation and causal dot-product for linear attention, storing intermediate states in fast GPU registers or shared memory (SRAM) rather than repeatedly accessing high-bandwidth memory (HBM). For sliding window attention, window sizes are chosen to maximize tensor core utilization.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**: By minimizing slow memory transfers and maximizing in-register/shared-memory computation, the design drastically reduces IO bottlenecks, which are the main practical limitation for linear attention and small-window attention on modern GPUs.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**:\n- Memory movement is reduced from O(BHNDd) (HBM↔SRAM) to O(BHNd′) (HBM↔SRAM), and from O(BHNDd) (SRAM↔register) to in-register computation for the KV-state.\n- Fused kernel: For each tile of tokens, compute feature maps and causal dot-products in one pass, updating the recurrent state in-register.\n\n**Computational_Properties**:\n- Drastically reduced IO cost; compute-bound rather than memory-bound for large batches.\n- Enables 24× throughput improvement over FlashAttention-2 in generation benchmarks.\n- Scales efficiently with batch size and sequence length, avoiding out-of-memory errors at long context.",
        "IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE": "**Integration_Strategy**: Replace standard linear attention and sliding window attention CUDA kernels with the provided IO-aware versions. Ensure that window sizes for sliding window attention match hardware-friendly multiples (e.g., 64 or 128) for best tensor core utilization.\n\n**Parameter_Settings**:\n- Tile sizes: Match to warp/thread block sizes for your GPU (e.g., 16–32 tokens per tile).\n- Store recurrent state in registers/shared memory wherever possible.\n- Use CUDA graph caching for next-token generation to further reduce kernel launch overhead.\n\n**Application_Conditions**: Apply when training or deploying LLMs with long sequences, large batch sizes, or on hardware where memory bandwidth is a bottleneck (e.g., A100/H100 GPUs). Especially valuable for production or research environments where wall-clock time is critical.\n\n**Expected_Outcomes**: Expect large gains in throughput and latency for both training and inference, especially in generation tasks. This enables practical deployment of BASED and similar architectures at scale, supporting longer contexts or larger batch sizes without hardware upgrades."
