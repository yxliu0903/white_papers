        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures**:  \n- Models using the delta-rule update (instead of additive sum) in linear attention show improved performance on tasks requiring dynamic context adaptation and memory overwriting, such as language modeling (training loss, lambada_openai), reading comprehension (squad_completion), and tasks with repeated or overwritten associations (arc_easy/arc_challenge, boolq).  \n- Smoother and lower training loss curves, with marked improvements in handling long sequences or context reassignments, especially when sequence length exceeds attention capacity.  \n- Enhanced performance in few-shot data augmentation (fda) and adaptation tasks, as the model can update and overwrite associations more effectively.\n\n**Architectural_Symptoms**:  \n- Training logs show faster convergence and less error accumulation in long-context or memory-overwriting scenarios; retrieval accuracy does not degrade sharply as sequence length increases past the attention dimension.",
        "BACKGROUND": "**Title**: Linear Transformers Are Secretly Fast Weight Programmers\n\n**Historical Technical Context**: Before this work, sequence modeling was dominated by RNNs, LSTMs, and, more recently, Transformers, which use self-attention to relate all input positions. Standard self-attention computes pairwise interactions between tokens using a softmax over dot products of key and query vectors, enabling powerful context modeling but at quadratic computational cost. Early fast weight programmers from the 1990s introduced the idea of neural networks dynamically generating and updating their own weights as a form of associative memory.\n\n**Technical Limitations**: Transformers' self-attention scales quadratically with sequence length, limiting their efficiency and context window for long sequences. Linearised attention methods reduce complexity but suffer from limited memory capacity and difficulty updating or overwriting stored associations. Prior models also lacked mechanisms for dynamically correcting or selectively editing memory contents.\n\n**Paper Concepts**: - **Fast Weight Programmer (FWP):** A model where a \"slow\" network learns to program the rapidly changing weights (\"fast weights\") of another network via additive outer products, enabling associative memory.\n- **Linearised Attention:** An approximation of softmax attention using kernel feature maps φ(·), so that attention can be computed as sums of outer products, reducing time and space complexity to linear in sequence length.\n- **Delta Rule Update:** An error-correcting update rule for associative memory, where stored associations are adjusted using a dynamically learned interpolation between new and existing values.\n- **Memory Capacity:** The maximum number of distinct key-value associations that can be reliably stored and retrieved, typically limited by the dimensionality of the projection space.\n- **Kernel Function φ(·):** A mapping applied to keys and queries in linear attention to enable efficient computation and control memory capacity and orthogonality.\n\n**Experimental Context**: The paper evaluates models on tasks requiring sequence memory and reasoning, such as synthetic key-value retrieval, language modeling, and machine translation. Assessment focuses on the ability to store, retrieve, and update associations over long contexts, using both generative and comprehension-based paradigms. Emphasis is placed on efficiency, capacity, and dynamic memory editing rather than only final prediction accuracy.",
        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**:  \n- Replace the standard additive outer product update in linear attention (W(i) = W(i-1) + v(i) ⊗ φ(k(i))) with a delta-rule:  \n  W(i) = W(i-1) + α(i) · (v(i) - ṽ(i)) ⊗ φ(k(i)),  \n  where ṽ(i) is the value currently associated with key k(i), α(i) is a dynamically learned interpolation weight (write-strength), and φ is the attention kernel mapping.  \n- The model retrieves the current value for a key, computes a convex combination between the new and old value, and updates the memory with this corrected association.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**:  \n- This approach enables the model to correct or overwrite previous key-value associations efficiently, addressing the limitation of purely additive updates that accumulate interference and cannot \"forget\" or update old associations.  \n- Dynamic, learned write-strength (α(i)) allows the model to control the degree of memory update per step, improving adaptation and stability in overcapacity regimes.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**:  \n- ṽ(i) = W(i-1) φ(k(i)) / [z(i-1)ᵀ φ(k(i))]  \n- α(i) = sigmoid(W_α x(i)) (learned per input)  \n- v_new(i) = α(i) v(i) + (1 - α(i)) ṽ(i)  \n- W(i) = W(i-1) + α(i) (v(i) - ṽ(i)) ⊗ φ(k(i))  \n- z(i) = z(i-1) + φ(k(i)) (optional normalization accumulator)\n\n**Computational_Properties**:  \n- Retains linear time and constant space complexity with respect to sequence length, as in standard linear attention.  \n- Marginal increase in computation and parameters (for α(i)), but negligible impact on throughput or memory footprint.  \n- Highly parallelizable and compatible with existing GPU/TPU kernels for linear attention.",
        "IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE": "**Integration_Strategy**:  \n- Modify the linear attention module: replace the standard additive update of the fast weight matrix with the delta-rule update.  \n- Add a small subnetwork (e.g., single linear layer + sigmoid) to compute α(i) per timestep from the input.  \n- Ensure retrieval of current value for key (ṽ(i)) is implemented efficiently, and normalization is applied as described.\n\n**Parameter_Settings**:  \n- α(i) ∈ (0, 1), typically initialized to favor moderate update rates (e.g., bias initialization in sigmoid).  \n- Kernel dimension (φ output) should match or exceed the number of unique associations expected in context.  \n- Normalization (sum over φ(k(i))) is recommended for stability, especially in long sequences.\n\n**Application_Conditions**:  \n- Most beneficial in tasks with frequent context or memory overwriting, or where sequence length regularly exceeds the attention capacity (e.g., long documents, dialogue, scientific QA).  \n- Apply when training loss curves flatten prematurely or retrieval accuracy degrades in long-context benchmarks.\n\n**Expected_Outcomes**:  \n- Improved training efficiency and robustness in long-sequence and memory-intensive tasks; better performance on lambada_openai, squad_completion, and arc_easy/challenge.  \n- Smoother training loss, less catastrophic forgetting, and increased adaptability in few-shot and data augmentation scenarios."

        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**:  \n- Replace standard attention kernel feature mappings (e.g., ELU+1 or random features) with a deterministic, parameter-free projection (DPFP) that increases the key/query feature dimension by generating sparse, orthogonal features through systematic combinations (e.g., pairwise rectified products of input components).  \n- For input key k ∈ ℝ^d, map to φ(k) ∈ ℝ^{2d·ν} via φ_i^ν(k) = ReLU([k; -k]_i) · ReLU([k; -k]_{i+ν}), where ν is a capacity hyperparameter controlling expansion.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**:  \n- By increasing the dimension and enforcing near-orthogonality in the projected space, DPFP allows the model to store and retrieve more associations without interference, directly addressing the memory capacity bottleneck of linear attention.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**:  \n- For each input k ∈ ℝ^d, φ: ℝ^d → ℝ^{2d·ν}, where each component is φ_i^ν(k) = max(0, [k; -k]_i) * max(0, [k; -k]_{i+ν})  \n- No learned parameters or stochasticity; all projections are deterministic and parallelizable.\n\n**Computational_Properties**:  \n- Linear time and space in sequence length; increased feature dimension (controlled by ν) trades off memory for capacity.  \n- No random sampling overhead (unlike Performer), fully deterministic and reproducible.  \n- Highly parallelizable due to independence of feature computations.",
