        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures**: Models lacking input-dependent sequence mixing (e.g., pure gated convolutions) will show disproportionately high training loss and perplexity on tokens requiring in-context recall, manifesting as underperformance on tasks that stress long-range or associative dependencies (e.g., lambada_openai, hellaswag, winogrande, squad_completion). When input-dependent mixing (e.g., attention or input-conditioned convolutions) is introduced, these metrics improve markedly, while general language modeling (training loss) and factual tasks (arc_easy/challenge, boolq) also benefit.\n\n**Architectural_Symptoms**: If a model's errors are concentrated on repeated or referenced entities/phrases within a context, and performance does not scale with model size, this indicates insufficient input-dependence in sequence mixing.",
        "BACKGROUND": "**Title**: Zoology: Measuring and Improving Recall in Efficient Language Models\n\n**Historical Technical Context**: Prior to this work, language models predominantly relied on architectures like RNNs, LSTMs, and especially Transformers, which use attention mechanisms to enable token-to-token interactions across long sequences. Recently, attention-free models combining gating (element-wise multiplication) and convolutions (sequence mixing via learned filters) have been proposed for greater computational efficiency. These gated-convolution models showed promise in synthetic tasks, suggesting they could rival attention-based models in language modeling quality.\n\n**Technical Limitations**: Despite efficiency gains, gated-convolution models underperform attention-based Transformers on real language modeling, particularly in recalling information from context (associative recall).

        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**: The paper formalizes the gap in real-world associative recall as a failure of input-independent (parameter-fixed) sequence mixers (like gated convolutions) to efficiently handle variable token-to-token dependencies required by natural language. It introduces the Multi-Query Associative Recall (MQAR) task to show that only input-dependent sequence mixing (e.g., attention or input-conditioned filters) can solve MQAR efficiently, with model capacity scaling independently of sequence length.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**: Input-dependent sequence mixing enables the model to dynamically route information based on the actual content and positions of tokens in the input, rather than relying on fixed convolutional kernels. This allows efficient and flexible recall of arbitrary associations present in the context, which is crucial for language modeling and in-context learning.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**: \n- Standard convolution: \\( y[i] = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} k[j] \\odot u[i-j] \\) (input-independent kernel \\( k \\))\n- Input-dependent mixing: \\( y[i] = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \\omega(i, j, u) \\cdot u[j] \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a function of the input (as in attention: \\( \\omega(i, j, u) = \\text{softmax}(q[i] \\cdot k[j]) \\))\n- MQAR requires that the model’s mixing weights depend on the current input to flexibly connect queries to their matching keys.\n\n**Computational_Properties**: \n- Input-independent convolutions: Near-linear time/space, high parallelization, but capacity for associative recall scales linearly with sequence length (inefficient).\n- Input-dependent mixing (e.g., attention): Quadratic time in sequence length, but capacity for associative recall is independent of sequence length; can be made sub-quadratic with sparse or selective attention.",
        "IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE": "**Integration_Strategy**: \n- For LLMs, ensure that sequence mixing modules (between MLP/state-mixing blocks) are input-dependent. This can be achieved by retaining attention layers or by augmenting convolutional models with input-conditioned filters or sparse attention modules.\n- In hybrid models, insert input-dependent modules at a minority of layers (e.g., 6–10%) to capture associative recall, leaving the rest as efficient convolutions.\n\n**Parameter_Settings**: \n- For sparse attention, select a small fraction of tokens (e.g., top-k based on learned or programmatic criteria) to apply attention, balancing efficiency and recall capacity.\n- For input-conditioned convolutional filters, ensure filter generation depends on local or global input statistics, not just learned parameters.\n\n**Application_Conditions**: \n- Apply input-dependent mixing when evaluation reveals a gap on tasks requiring in-context recall (lambada_openai, hellaswag, winogrande, squad_completion) or when perplexity is disproportionately high on repeated/referenced tokens.\n- For efficiency-critical deployments, use sparse or selective attention rather than full attention.\n\n**Expected_Outcomes**: \n- Substantial improvements in tasks requiring associative recall and context understanding, with smoother training loss curves and convergence.\n- Hybrid models approach or match attention-only performance on context-dependent metrics, while retaining computational efficiency closer to convolutional models."

        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures**: Introducing sparse, input-dependent attention layers into a primarily convolutional model sharply reduces training loss and perplexity on associative recall tokens, and closes the gap on context-heavy benchmarks (lambada_openai, hellaswag, winogrande, squad_completion) without degrading performance on factual (arc_easy/challenge, boolq) or structured extraction tasks (swde). Computational cost remains sub-quadratic, and overall convergence is faster compared to full attention models.\n\n**Architectural_Symptoms**: Models with only a small fraction of attention layers, targeted to tokens likely to require recall (e.g., repeated n-grams), achieve nearly all the benefits of full attention on recall metrics, with only a modest increase in computational requirements.",

        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**: The paper demonstrates that adding a small number of attention layers (typically <10% of total layers) with input-dependent sparsity—where attention is only computed for tokens identified as likely recall points (e.g., repeated bigrams)—enables convolutional models to match or outperform full attention models on associative recall and language modeling tasks, while maintaining sub-quadratic scaling.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**: By leveraging programmatic or learned selection functions to identify tokens requiring associative recall, attention can be selectively applied, providing dynamic, context-sensitive information routing only where it is most needed, thus achieving the key benefits of attention with minimal overhead.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**: \n- Sparse attention: \\( y[i] = \\text{softmax}(q[i] \\cdot k^T) v \\cdot f(u)[i] \\), where \\( f(u)[i] \\) is a binary selector (1 for tokens requiring recall, 0 otherwise).\n- Selection functions: Programmatic (e.g., \\( f(x)[i] = 1 \\) if \\( x_i \\) previously occurred in the sequence), or learned (e.g., \\( f(u)[i] = \\sigma(u[i] W) \\) with top-k selection).\n\n**Computational_Properties**: \n- Sub-quadratic time/space complexity (proportional to the number of selected tokens, not full sequence length).\n- Retains high parallelization and memory efficiency of convolutional models for most layers.\n- Minimal increase in parameter count and FLOPs compared to pure convolutions.",
        "IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE": "**Integration_Strategy**: \n- In primarily convolutional LLMs, insert sparse attention layers at <10% of total layers.\n- Implement selection functions for attention application: start with programmatic heuristics (e.g., repeated token detection), then optionally transition to learned selection for more flexibility.\n- For learned selectors, use a small auxiliary loss to encourage sparsity and exploration.\n\n**Parameter_Settings**: \n- Number of attention layers: 6–10% of total.\n- For learned selectors, set k (number of attended tokens per batch) proportional to sequence length but much smaller (e.g., k = 128–512 for typical sequence lengths).\n- Use Gaussian noise and regularization in learned selectors to avoid overfitting and encourage robust selection.\n\n**Application_Conditions**: \n- Use when profiling reveals that most of the model’s errors are due to missed in-context associations, but full attention is computationally prohibitive.\n- Particularly beneficial for long-sequence or memory-intensive language modeling, as well as when inference efficiency is critical.\n\n**Expected_Outcomes**: \n- Near-complete closure of the associative recall gap (as measured by lambada_openai, hellaswag, winogrande, squad_completion), with overall language modeling loss and convergence matching or exceeding attention-only baselines.\n- Maintained or improved efficiency (lower FLOPs, memory) versus full attention models, enabling practical deployment at larger sequence lengths or on resource-constrained hardware."
