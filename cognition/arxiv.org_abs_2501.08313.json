        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**:  \nThe model alternates between several blocks (e.g., 7) of lightning (linear) attention layers and a single softmax attention layer throughout the transformer stack. Lightning attention uses a tiled, I/O-aware linear attention approach for O(N) scaling, while periodic softmax layers restore full retrieval and precise long-range dependency modeling.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**:  \nLinear attention provides scalable, efficient context handling for long sequences, but struggles with retrieval and in-context learning. Interleaving softmax layers periodically restores the model’s ability to perform high-fidelity retrieval and complex reasoning, while keeping overall compute and memory costs linear in sequence length.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**:  \n- Lightning (linear) attention:  \n  \\( O = \\text{Norm}(Q(K^TV)) \\) with tiled block-wise partitioning to avoid cumsum bottleneck.\n- Hybrid stacking: For every N layers, L_linear use linear attention, then 1 layer uses softmax attention:  \n  \\( \\text{for } i \\in [1, L]: \\)  \n  \\( \\quad \\text{if } i \\bmod (L_{\\text{linear}}+1) == 0: \\)  \n  \\( \\qquad \\text{SoftmaxAttention} \\)  \n  \\( \\quad \\text{else:} \\)  \n  \\( \\qquad \\text{LightningAttention} \\)\n\n**Computational_Properties**:  \n- O(N) time and space for most layers, O(N^2) only for sparse softmax layers.\n- Highly parallelizable due to block-wise tiling.\n- Enables context windows of 1M+ tokens with affordable memory and compute.\n- Training and inference speed nearly constant w.r.t. context length.",
