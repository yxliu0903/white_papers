        "DESIGN_INSIGHT": "### DESIGN_INSIGHT_1: Monotonically Increasing Lower Bounds on Forget Gates for Layerwise Dependency Control\n\n**Paper's Unique Algorithmic Contribution:**  \nHGRN introduces a learnable, monotonically increasing lower bound on the forget gate (decay rate) in each RNN layer. Lower layers have small lower bounds (can forget more), while higher layers have large lower bounds (retain more), enabling hierarchical separation of short-term and long-term dependency modeling within the same stack.",
        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures:**  \n- Improved modeling of long-range dependencies manifests as higher lambada_openai, hellaswag, and LRA (Long Range Arena) scores, with smoother and faster training loss decrease, especially on tasks requiring context retention over many tokens.\n- Enhanced factual and reasoning performance is expected on arc_easy/arc_challenge and openbookqa due to better retention of global context in upper layers, while local reasoning (winogrande, squad_completion) remains stable or slightly improved.\n- Ablation studies show that removing the lower bound causes significant drops in long-context and long-sequence tasks (LRA, lambada), but less so in short-context tasks.\n\n**Architectural_Symptoms:**  \n- Layerwise analysis will reveal higher average forget gate values in upper layers (approaching 1), and lower values in lower layers, mapping to the model's ability to retain or discard information as needed.",
