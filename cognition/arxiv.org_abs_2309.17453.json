        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures**:  \n- Models using only a rolling window of recent tokens (window attention) show a sharp drop in performance (spiking training loss, perplexity, and random outputs) once sequence length exceeds the cache size—especially on long-context tasks like lambada_openai, squad_completion, and arc_easy/challenge.  \n- Retaining a small number (typically 4) of initial tokens as \"attention sinks\" in the KV cache, alongside the rolling window, restores stable perplexity and maintains performance on long-sequence tasks. This manifests as:  \n    - Smooth, low training loss even for very long sequences  \n    - Stable lambada_openai, hellaswag, arc_easy/challenge, squad_completion, and winogrande scores at sequence lengths far beyond pretraining window  \n    - No degradation in commonsense (piqa, social_iqa) or factual (openbookqa, boolq) metrics  \n- No improvement in few-shot adaptation (fda) or structured extraction (swde), as the mechanism primarily affects context length generalization.\n\n**Architectural_Symptoms**:  \n- When initial tokens are not retained, attention maps in deep layers show erratic or collapsed distributions; with attention sinks, attention maps remain stable across layers and heads even for millions of tokens.",
        "BACKGROUND": "**Title**: Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks\n\n**Historical Technical Context**: Prior to this work, language models were primarily based on Transformer architectures, which use self-attention mechanisms to model dependencies across entire input sequences. Techniques like dense attention require storing all past token states, while window attention caches only the most recent tokens, and sliding window with recomputation periodically rebuilds the cache for efficient inference. Relative positional encodings such as RoPE and ALiBi extended the Transformer’s ability to model longer contexts, but models were still fundamentally limited by their pre-training attention window size.\n\n**Technical Limitations**: Existing models face two main bottlenecks: memory usage grows with sequence length due to key-value (KV) caching, and model performance degrades sharply when processing inputs longer than the pre-training window. Window attention, while efficient, fails when initial tokens are evicted, as Transformers tend to assign significant attention to these early positions regardless of semantic relevance. No prior approach enabled stable, efficient language modeling on truly infinite-length streams without fine-tuning or recomputation overhead.\n\n**Paper Concepts**: - <b>Attention Sink</b>: Tokens (usually initial tokens) that consistently receive high attention scores, acting as \"sinks\" for surplus attention due to the Softmax normalization in self-attention.\n- <b>StreamingLLM</b>: A framework that augments window attention by retaining a small number of initial tokens’ KV states (attention sinks) alongside recent tokens, enabling stable performance on unbounded input streams.\n- <b>Key-Value (KV) Cache</b>: The stored representations of past tokens used for efficient autoregressive decoding in Transformers.\n- <b>Sink Token</b>: A learnable placeholder token introduced during pre-training to serve as a dedicated attention sink, eliminating the need to retain multiple initial tokens.\n\n**Experimental Context**: The paper evaluates models on language modeling tasks requiring generation and comprehension over extremely long, continuous texts, simulating real-world streaming scenarios such as extended dialogue and multi-turn question answering. Evaluation focuses on maintaining prediction quality and efficiency as sequence length grows far beyond training limits, using metrics like perplexity and accuracy in settings demanding both memory efficiency and stable long-range reasoning.",
        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**:  \n- During decoding/inference, instead of caching only the last N tokens' Key/Value (KV) states (window attention), always cache and include the KV for the first K tokens (attention sinks, typically K=4) plus the most recent N tokens.  \n- Attention computation for each new token includes both the initial K tokens and the rolling window of N recent tokens, ensuring stable softmax normalization and attention distribution even as total sequence length grows arbitrarily.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**:  \n- LLMs exhibit a learned bias to allocate excess attention to initial tokens, regardless of their semantics, due to softmax normalization and the autoregressive training setup. Removing these \"attention sinks\" destabilizes attention and causes performance collapse. Retaining them anchors the attention distribution, enabling stable infinite-length streaming.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**:  \n- For a given decoding step t, the set of tokens attended is:  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Attended Tokens} = \\{ \\text{tokens } 0,1,\\dots,K-1 \\} \\cup \\{ \\text{tokens } t-N, t-N+1, \\dots, t-1 \\}\n  \\]\n  Attention weights are computed as usual, but the softmax denominator always includes the K sink tokens.\n\n- Position encodings (e.g., RoPE, ALiBi) must be recomputed so that positions in the cache are contiguous, not based on absolute positions in the original sequence.\n\n**Computational_Properties**:  \n- Memory: O(N+K) for KV cache (constant, regardless of total sequence length; K is small).\n- Time: O(N+K) per token, same as window attention, but with no need for quadratic recomputation.\n- Highly parallelizable; does not increase per-token compute.\n- Decoding latency and memory are stable and low even for millions of tokens.",
        "IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE": "**Integration_Strategy**:  \n- At inference/decoding, modify the KV cache management logic in the transformer stack:\n    - Always retain the first K tokens' KV states as a fixed \"sink\" segment.\n    - Maintain the usual rolling window of N most recent tokens.\n    - When computing attention, concatenate the sink segment and the rolling window as the context.\n- Ensure relative position encodings are recomputed so that positions in the cache are contiguous, not absolute.\n\n**Parameter_Settings**:  \n- K (number of initial tokens to retain): Empirically, 4 suffices for most pretrained LLMs; further increases yield diminishing returns.\n- N (rolling window size): Set based on memory/computation constraints (typically matches or is less than pretraining context window).\n- No model weights or architecture changes required; works as a drop-in inference-time modification.\n\n**Application_Conditions**:  \n- Apply when deploying existing LLMs (pretrained with standard autoregressive methods, no dedicated sink token) for streaming or infinite-length generation.\n- Especially beneficial when observed training loss or perplexity spikes at sequence lengths exceeding pretraining window, or when outputs become random in long-context tasks.\n\n**Expected_Outcomes**:  \n- Restores and stabilizes model performance on all tasks requiring long-range context (lambada_openai, squad_completion, arc_easy/challenge, winogrande, hellaswag) at sequence lengths vastly exceeding pretraining.\n- No degradation in other metrics (commonsense, factual, adaptation, extraction).\n- Dramatic reduction in memory and latency compared to dense attention or recomputation baselines, enabling practical streaming LLM deployment."
