        "DESIGN_INSIGHT": "### DESIGN_INSIGHT_1: Learnable Affine-Transformed Quadratic Kernel in Linear Transformers\n\nThe paper introduces a kernel-based attention mechanism for Linear Transformers where the kernel function is a learnable, affine-transformed quadratic: ùúô(x) = (Œ≥¬∑norm(x) + Œ≤)¬≤, with separate Œ≥ and Œ≤ parameters for queries and keys. This allows the model to adapt the kernel's scale, shift, and curvature during training, enabling it to assign near-zero attention to irrelevant tokens and dynamically align the kernel's minimum to the data distribution. Layer normalization is applied to inputs prior to the kernel.",
        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures**: Enhanced in-context learning and associative recall manifest as improved scores on lambada_openai, winogrande, and hellaswag, especially for long sequences and small model sizes. Training loss decreases more smoothly on language modeling tasks, and perplexity on AR (associative recall) tokens is reduced compared to previous linear transformer variants. Gains are most pronounced on tasks requiring long-range dependency modeling, with stable or improved performance on arc_easy/challenge and boolq.\n\n**Architectural_Symptoms**: Training curves show less degradation with increasing sequence length; attention matrices become more focused, resembling those of standard attention, with the ability to suppress irrelevant context.",
        "BACKGROUND": "**Title**: Linear Transformers with Learnable Kernel Functions are Better In-Context Models\n\n**Historical Technical Context**: Prior to this work, dominant architectures for language modeling included RNNs and LSTMs, which process tokens sequentially and struggle with long-range dependencies, and Transformers, which use self-attention mechanisms for parallel sequence processing but incur quadratic computational cost with sequence length. Linear Transformers were introduced to reduce this cost by replacing the softmax attention with kernel-based approximations, enabling linear scaling. State Space Models and hybrid architectures further explored alternatives for efficient long-context modeling.\n\n**Technical Limitations**: Traditional Transformers are limited by their O(N¬≤) time and memory complexity, making them impractical for very long sequences. Early linear attention models and State Space Models, while more efficient, often suffered from reduced in-context learning ability and struggled to match Transformer-level performance on associative recall and context-dependent tasks. Existing linear kernels (e.g., Taylor expansions) could not assign near-zero attention to irrelevant tokens, limiting selective focus.\n\n**Paper Concepts**: - <b>Linear Attention:</b> An attention mechanism approximating softmax(QK·µÄ) with a kernel function œÜ(¬∑), enabling O(N) complexity by factorizing sim(q, k) ‚âà œÜ(q)·µÄœÜ(k).\n- <b>Kernel Function:</b> A function œÜ(¬∑) used to transform queries and keys before computing attention; in this paper, learnable quadratic kernels with affine transformations are proposed.\n- <b>In-Context Learning:</b> The model's ability to use context within the input sequence to solve tasks such as associative recall, without parameter updates.\n- <b>Multi-Query Associative Recall (MQAR):</b> A task measuring the ability to retrieve multiple tokens from long contexts, used to evaluate models' selective memory and attention.\n\n**Experimental Context**: Evaluation focuses on tasks requiring reasoning over long contexts, such as associative recall, few-shot question answering, and language generation. Models are assessed for both overall language modeling quality (perplexity) and their ability to retrieve or manipulate contextual information within a sequence. The experimental philosophy emphasizes measuring both short- and long-range dependency modeling and robustness to increased sequence length.",
        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**: The attention kernel is parameterized as ùúô(x) = (Œ≥¬∑norm(x) + Œ≤)¬≤, where norm(x) is the normalized query/key vector, and Œ≥, Œ≤ are learnable parameters (potentially per-head or per-layer). This replaces the fixed Taylor-approximation kernel of Based with a learnable, data-adaptive version. The kernel is applied separately to queries and keys before forming the linear attention product.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**: By making the kernel's minimum value and curvature learnable, the model can assign true zero attention to irrelevant tokens (solving the ‚Äúminimum similarity > 0‚Äù problem), adapt to varying data distributions, and better separate relevant from irrelevant context, particularly in long-range dependency scenarios.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**:\n- For query q and key k:\n  - norm(q) = LayerNorm(q), norm(k) = LayerNorm(k)\n  - ùúô_Q(q) = (Œ≥_Q¬∑norm(q) + Œ≤_Q)¬≤\n  - ùúô_K(k) = (Œ≥_K¬∑norm(k) + Œ≤_K)¬≤\n- Attention score: sim(q, k) = ùúô_Q(q)·µÄ ùúô_K(k)\n- Linear attention: y·µ¢ = (ùúô_Q(q·µ¢)·µÄ Œ£_{j‚â§i} ùúô_K(k‚±º) v‚±º) / (ùúô_Q(q·µ¢)·µÄ Œ£_{j‚â§i} ùúô_K(k‚±º))\n\n**Computational_Properties**: Retains O(Nd¬≤) time and space complexity (linear in sequence length), highly parallelizable, and supports efficient incremental inference. The addition of a few learnable parameters per head/layer has negligible overhead. LayerNorm introduces minor extra computation but improves stability.",
        "IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE": "**Integration_Strategy**: Replace the kernel function in the linear attention module of a Linear Transformer with the learnable affine-transformed quadratic kernel. Insert LayerNorm before the kernel function for both queries and keys. Œ≥ and Œ≤ can be initialized to match the original kernel (e.g., Œ≥=1, Œ≤=0) and learned during training.\n\n**Parameter_Settings**: Use separate Œ≥ and Œ≤ for queries and keys, per head or per layer. Initialize Œ≥ close to 1 and Œ≤ close to 0 for stability. Ensure LayerNorm is applied before the kernel. Monitor for vanishing or exploding kernel outputs; regularization or clipping may be beneficial.\n\n**Application_Conditions**: Use when standard linear transformers (with fixed kernels) underperform on long-context tasks, especially where associative recall or in-context learning is critical. Particularly beneficial when sequence length is large and model capacity is limited.\n\n**Expected_Outcomes**: Expect improved in-context learning and associative recall (lambada_openai, winogrande, hellaswag), smoother training loss curves, and reduced perplexity on AR tokens. No significant degradation on factual or short-context tasks (arc_easy/challenge, boolq), and improved robustness to sequence length increases."

        "DESIGN_INSIGHT": "### DESIGN_INSIGHT_2: Hybrid Linear Attention + Short Convolutional Mixer for Short-Range Dependency Modeling\n\nThe architecture combines linear attention (with the improved learnable kernel) and a short convolutional layer (kernel size 3) as the first layer, followed by an attention-based mixer. This hybrid structure compensates for linear attention's weakness in modeling short-range, non-associative dependencies, stabilizing training and improving both short- and long-range context handling.",
        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures**: Performance remains strong or improves on tasks that mix short- and long-context dependencies (e.g., lambada_openai, hellaswag, piqa, social_iqa), with more stable training loss and less performance drop on short sequences. Short-context tasks (arc_easy, boolq, squad_completion) maintain baseline or slightly improved scores.\n\n**Architectural_Symptoms**: Models with this hybrid structure exhibit less sensitivity to sequence length in training loss and accuracy; ablation studies show performance drops when the convolutional layer is removed.",

        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**: The input sequence is first processed by a short convolutional layer (kernel size 3), capturing local dependencies and smoothing the feature space. The output is then passed to the linear attention module (with the learnable kernel).

Ensure the convolution is applied per head or per channel as appropriate.\n\n**Parameter_Settings**: Kernel size 3 for the convolutional layer is recommended; weight initialization can follow standard Conv1D practices. Number of channels should match the model's hidden size.\n\n**Application_Conditions**: Use when language modeling or downstream tasks require both local and global context understanding, or when training instability is observed with pure linear attention. Especially valuable for datasets with rich short-range structure.\n\n**Expected_Outcomes**: Improved performance and stability across both short- and long-context tasks (lambada_openai, hellaswag, piqa, social_iqa, squad_completion), with training loss curves less sensitive to sequence length and more robust convergence."
