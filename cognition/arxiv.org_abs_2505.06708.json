        "DESIGN_INSIGHT": "### DESIGN_INSIGHT_1: Head-Specific, Query-Dependent Sigmoid Gating After SDPA\n\n**Paper's Unique Algorithmic Contribution:**  \nThe paper demonstrates that inserting a head-specific, multiplicative sigmoid gate immediately after the Scaled Dot-Product Attention (SDPA) output in each attention head—using the current query's hidden state to compute the gate—consistently yields the largest performance and stability improvements across tasks and model sizes. This simple modification introduces non-linearity and strong input-dependent sparsity into the attention computation, directly addressing key bottlenecks in standard Transformer attention.",
        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures:**  \n- Expect smoother, lower training loss curves with fewer spikes and better convergence, especially at higher learning rates or larger batch sizes.\n- Improvements will be most pronounced on tasks requiring long-range context and narrative understanding (lambada_openai, hellaswag), as well as factual and commonsense reasoning (arc_easy/challenge, boolq, piqa, social_iqa).\n- Pronoun resolution and reading comprehension tasks (winogrande, squad_completion) also benefit, but structured extraction (swde) and few-shot adaptation (fda) see neutral or minor gains.\n- In long-context extrapolation (extended context windows), models with this gating maintain performance better than baselines, with much less degradation on benchmarks like RULER.\n\n**Architectural_Symptoms:**  \n- Training with this gating allows use of larger learning rates without divergence, and models show reduced \"attention sink\" (less disproportionate focus on early tokens).",
        "BACKGROUND": "**Title**: Gated Attention for Large Language Models: Non-linearity, Sparsity, and Attention-Sink-Free\n\n**Historical Technical Context**: Prior to this work, large language models were predominantly built on Transformer architectures, which use multi-head self-attention with softmax normalization to mix information across sequences. Earlier architectures like RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs used gating to control information flow over time, while Transformers relied on stacked linear projections and softmax attention. Gating was commonly applied in recurrent nets and feedforward layers, but its precise role in attention mechanisms remained underexplored.\n\n**Technical Limitations**: Standard attention layers in Transformers are fundamentally linear between value and output projections, limiting expressiveness and making them susceptible to \"attention sink,\" where attention mass concentrates on a few tokens.

        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm:**  \n- For each attention head, after computing the SDPA output, multiply it elementwise by a gate vector:  \n  `Y' = Y ⊙ σ(XW_θ)`,  \n  where `Y` is the SDPA output, `X` is the pre-norm hidden state for the current query, `W_θ` is a learnable weight, and `σ` is the sigmoid function.  \n- The gate is computed independently for each head (head-specific) and depends only on the current query token (query-dependent), enabling dynamic, token- and head-specific modulation.\n\n**Key_Mechanism:**  \n- This mechanism injects non-linearity between the value and output projections (addressing the low-rank expressiveness bottleneck), and creates strong, input-dependent sparsity in the attention output, filtering out irrelevant context.\n- The sparsity and dynamic gating eliminate the \"attention sink\" effect, where early tokens dominate attention, thus enhancing both stability and context generalization.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation:**  \n- For each head and token:  \n  `Gate = σ(X_i W_θ)`  \n  `Y'_i = Y_i ⊙ Gate`  \n  Where `Y_i` is the SDPA output for the i-th token/head, `X_i` is the query hidden state, and `⊙` denotes elementwise multiplication.\n\n**Computational_Properties:**  \n- Negligible parameter and compute overhead (<2% wall-time increase), highly parallelizable as gating is a simple elementwise operation.\n- Memory and compute cost are dominated by the gating projection, which is small relative to the rest of the attention block.\n- Improves training stability, reduces risk of numerical errors (especially in lower-precision training), and enables larger learning rates/batch sizes.",
        "IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE": "**Integration_Strategy:**  \n- Insert the gating mechanism immediately after the SDPA output and before the output projection in each attention head.\n- Use the pre-norm hidden state as the gating input; implement as a small linear layer (per head) followed by a sigmoid.\n- For multi-head attention, ensure gating is head-specific (unique per head), not shared.\n\n**Parameter_Settings:**  \n- Gate projection size matches the attention head dimension (`dk`).\n- Use sigmoid activation for multiplicative gating; initialize gate weights with small random values (e.g., standard initialization for linear layers).\n- No need to tune the gate sparsity directly; the sigmoid naturally induces sparse outputs.\n\n**Application_Conditions:**  \n- Apply when training large LLMs on long-context data, or when encountering unstable training (loss spikes, divergence at high learning rates).\n- Particularly beneficial for models needing to extrapolate to longer contexts, or where attention sinks are observed (excessive focus on BOS/first tokens).\n- Use in both dense and MoE models; compatible with group query attention and other attention variants.\n\n**Expected_Outcomes:**  \n- Lower, smoother training loss; improved stability and convergence at higher learning rates/batch sizes.\n- Stronger performance on long-context, reasoning, and narrative understanding tasks (lambada_openai, hellaswag, arc_easy/challenge, boolq, piqa, social_iqa).\n- Better retention of performance when extending context length (less drop-off on RULER/YaRN).\n- No adverse effects on structured data extraction (swde) or few-shot adaptation (fda)."

        "DESIGN_INSIGHT": "### DESIGN_INSIGHT_2: Non-Linearity and Sparsity in Attention via Gating Position and Granularity\n\n**Paper's Unique Algorithmic Contribution:**  \nThe study reveals that the primary benefits of gating arise from (a) introducing non-linearity between the value and output projections in attention, and (b) enforcing strong, input-dependent sparsity—especially when the gating is query-dependent and head-specific. Gating after the value projection (G2) also helps, but the effect is strongest when applied after SDPA (G1), due to the direct modulation of the attended context. The granularity of gating (elementwise vs. headwise) and sharing of gating scores (head-specific vs. shared) further modulate these effects.",
