        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures**:  \n- Models with data-dependent forget gates in attention show lower training loss, especially in long-context language modeling, and outperform standard Transformers on lambada_openai (narrative completion/long-range dependency), as well as on short-context downstream tasks (e.g., piqa, boolq, arc_easy/challenge, openbookqa).  \n- Forgetting Attention models maintain or improve performance on long-context tasks (needle-in-the-haystack, squad_completion, swde) and exhibit more robust length extrapolation (i.e., per-token loss remains decreasing beyond training context length).\n- Gains are most pronounced in tasks requiring both recency and long-range context, such as hellaswag, winogrande, and social_iqa.\n**Architectural_Symptoms**:  \n- Training loss curves decrease more smoothly and per-token loss does not plateau prematurely, indicating full context utilization. Attention visualizations reveal learned recency bias when beneficial, but the model can also retain long-range information as needed.",
        "BACKGROUND": "**Title**: Forgetting Transformer: Softmax Attention with a Forget Gate\n\n**Historical Technical Context**: Before this work, dominant sequence models included RNNs and LSTMs, which process inputs sequentially with explicit recurrence and gating mechanisms such as the forget gate to manage memory. Transformers, using self-attention (notably softmax attention), replaced recurrence with parallel processing and positional embeddings, enabling superior long-context modeling and scalability. Recent research also explored recurrent models with linear attention and gating, but these typically struggled with long-range dependencies compared to Transformers.\n\n**Technical Limitations**: Transformers lack explicit, data-dependent mechanisms for forgetting irrelevant past information, potentially limiting efficiency and adaptability for varying context lengths. Recurrent models have forget gates but cannot match Transformers’ long-context utilization due to fixed-size hidden states and limited context access. Prior attempts at adding decay or position-based bias to attention were mostly data-independent and less flexible.\n\n**Paper Concepts**: - **Forget Gate ($f_t = \\sigma(w_f^\\top x_t + b_f)$):** A scalar, data-dependent gating value at each timestep that modulates memory retention, inspired by LSTM mechanisms.\n- **Forgetting Attention:** Modified softmax attention where unnormalized attention scores are down-weighted by cumulative forget gates, enabling selective context retention.\n- **FoX (Forgetting Transformer):** A Transformer variant incorporating Forgetting Attention, allowing data-dependent forgetting within parallel attention.\n- **Pro Block:** An enhanced architectural design integrating output gating, output normalization, QK-norm, and key/value shifts, improving both FoX and standard Transformers.\n\n**Experimental Context**: Evaluation focuses on language modeling with very long contexts, length extrapolation, and diverse downstream tasks covering reasoning, comprehension, question answering, and generation. Performance is assessed via per-token loss, perplexity, and specialized retrieval tests to probe context utilization and information retention. Both zero-shot and few-shot settings are used to measure generalization and adaptation to various task types.",
        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**:  \n- Incorporate a scalar, data-dependent forget gate \\( f_t = \\sigma(w_f^T x_t + b_f) \\) at each timestep into the softmax attention mechanism.  \n- Modify the attention logits by adding a cumulative log-forget bias: \\( o_i = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^i F_{ij} \\exp(q_i^T k_j) v_j}{\\sum_{j=1}^i F_{ij} \\exp(q_i^T k_j)} \\) where \\( F_{ij} = \\prod_{l=j+1}^i f_l \\) and \\( D_{ij} = \\log F_{ij} \\).  \n- In matrix form: \\( O = \\text{softmax}(QK^T + D)V \\), where \\( D \\) is a lower-triangular matrix of cumulative log-forget values.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**:  \n- The forget gate enables the attention mechanism to dynamically down-weight less relevant (typically older) context in a content-aware manner, combining the benefits of recency bias (as in RNNs) with the full-context modeling of Transformers. This enhances both short-term focus and long-term memory as needed by the task.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**:  \n- Forget gate: \\( f_t = \\sigma(w_f^T x_t + b_f) \\)  \n- Cumulative forget: \\( F_{ij} = \\prod_{l=j+1}^i f_l \\), \\( D_{ij} = \\log F_{ij} \\)  \n- Attention output: \\( O = \\text{softmax}(QK^T + D)V \\)\n\n**Computational_Properties**:  \n- Adds negligible computational and memory overhead (only a scalar per position per head).\n- Compatible with FlashAttention and highly parallelizable: cumulative sums for \\( D \\) can be efficiently computed and used as a bias in the attention kernel.\n- No need for positional embeddings, simplifying memory and training pipeline.",
        "IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE": "**Integration_Strategy**:  \n- Replace standard softmax attention in each Transformer block with Forgetting Attention:  \n  - Add a small MLP (or a linear layer) per attention head to compute the forget gate for each token.\n  - Compute and apply the cumulative log-forget bias to the attention logits before softmax.\n  - Remove positional embeddings unless specific downstream tasks show benefit from them.\n\n**Parameter_Settings**:  \n- Forget gate is a scalar per token per head, initialized via standard methods (e.g., bias initialized to favor moderate forgetting).\n- Tune number of heads and head dimension; FoX often prefers more heads with smaller dimensions.\n- Learning rate may need to be higher than baseline Transformer; Pro blocks also benefit from higher learning rates.\n- If using data-independent (fixed or static) forget gates, initialize to match the desired decay profile (see ALiBi equivalence), but data-dependent gates consistently outperform.\n\n**Application_Conditions**:  \n- Apply when models exhibit premature loss plateauing (i.e., not fully using long context), or when short-context downstream task performance is lagging.\n- Especially effective for medium-scale models (hundreds of millions of parameters) and when training context length is large relative to model size.\n- Use for tasks or domains where both recency and long-term dependencies are important.\n\n**Expected_Outcomes**:  \n- Improved training loss and validation perplexity, especially at later token positions (longer contexts).\n- Robust gains on lambada_openai, hellaswag, piqa, winogrande, arc_easy/challenge, boolq, and openbookqa; maintains or improves on squad_completion and swde.\n- Length extrapolation beyond training context length is more stable; attention visualizations show adaptive recency bias.\n- No regression on long-context tasks; no need for positional embeddings simplifies architecture."

        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**:  \n- Augment each Transformer block with:  \n  - Output gate (a learned scalar gate on the block output, as in RNNs/LSTMs/Mamba).\n  - Output normalization (RMSNorm applied to block output, often per head).\n  - QK-norm (normalize queries and keys before attention).\n  - Data-dependent token shift (KV-shift): keys and values are computed as a convex combination of current and previous token projections, weighted by a learned gate.\n- These additions are orthogonal to Forgetting Attention and can be used in any Transformer variant.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**:  \n- Output gates and normalization stabilize gradient flow and allow the model to selectively route block outputs, improving both optimization and generalization.\n- QK-norm and KV-shift regularize attention, enabling better context mixing and reducing overfitting to positional patterns.\n- Together, these mimic beneficial properties of recurrent models (explicit gating, controlled state updates) within a parallel Transformer.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**:  \n- Output gate: \\( o' = g \\cdot o \\), \\( g = \\sigma(w^T x + b) \\)\n- Output normalization: \\( o_{norm} = \\text{RMSNorm}(o') \\)\n- QK-norm: \\( q, k = \\text{normalize}(q), \\text{normalize}(k) \\)\n- KV-shift: \\( \\tilde{k}_t = W_k x_t \\), \\( \\alpha^{key}_t = \\sigma(w_k^T x_t) \\), \\( k_t = \\text{RMSNorm}(\\alpha^{key}_t \\tilde{k}_{t-1} + (1 - \\alpha^{key}_t)\\tilde{k}_t) \\) (similarly for values, without RMSNorm)\n\n**Computational_Properties**:  \n- Minimal overhead: all operations are elementwise or small MLPs, easily parallelized.\n- Compatible with standard GPU/TPU acceleration, including FlashAttention.\n- Improves training stability and convergence, especially for large context lengths.",
