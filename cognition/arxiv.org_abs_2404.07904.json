        "DESIGN_INSIGHT": "### DESIGN_INSIGHT_HIGH: Outer Product-Based State Expansion for Recurrent State (HGRN2)\n\n**Paper's Unique Algorithmic Contribution:**  \nHGRN2 introduces an outer product-based mechanism to expand the recurrent state of a gated linear RNN from a vector (size d) to a matrix (size d×d), dramatically increasing memory capacity and expressiveness **without introducing additional parameters**. This is achieved by replacing element-wise gating operations with matrix operations: the hidden state is updated using a matrix recurrence involving the diagonalized forget gate and an outer product between the input and the complement of the forget gate.",
        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures:**  \n- Improved modeling of long-range dependencies and in-context recall will manifest as higher scores on **lambada_openai, hellaswag, squad_completion, winogrande**, and especially **SCROLLs** and **Needle in a Haystack**-style retrieval tasks.  \n- Expect smoother and lower **training loss** curves, especially for longer sequences, and consistent gains in **commonsense and factual reasoning** tasks (**arc_easy/challenge, piqa, openbookqa, social_iqa**).\n- Gains are most pronounced as model/state size increases, with diminishing returns beyond a certain expansion ratio (e.g., n > 128).\n\n**Architectural_Symptoms:**  \n- Models with this mechanism show superior scaling in long-context benchmarks and maintain competitive performance on both narrative and structured tasks, while keeping parameter count nearly constant.",
