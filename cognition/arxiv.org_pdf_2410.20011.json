For kernel-based methods, replace softmax with kernel feature maps; for LSH, insert hashing and bucketed computation; for state-space, replace attention entirely with recurrent/state-space modules.\n\n**Parameter_Settings**: Tune feature map dimension (kernel methods), number of hash buckets (LSH), or state-space transition parameters. Use standard transformer initialization, but consider scaling factors to maintain variance. Adjust batch size/context window upward to leverage efficiency gains.\n\n**Application_Conditions**: Apply when memory/compute is a bottleneck, especially for long-context or on-device scenarios. Most beneficial when inference latency and throughput are critical, or when training on limited hardware.\n\n**Expected_Outcomes**: Expect smoother training loss curves, improved inference speed, and maintained or improved performance on context-rich benchmarks (lambada_openai, squad_completion, hellaswag). May allow for longer context windows, supporting better performance on tasks involving narrative flow or long-range dependencies."
