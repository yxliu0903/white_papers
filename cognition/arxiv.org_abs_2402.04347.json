        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures**: Models using Hedgehog linear attention will display performance nearly matching standard softmax attention across all language modeling and reasoning tasks (e.g., lambada_openai, boolq, arc_easy/challenge, openbookqa, squad_completion), with especially pronounced improvements over previous linear attention methods in tasks requiring selective focus and context integration (e.g., lambada_openai, winogrande, hellaswag). Training loss curves will show smooth convergence similar to softmax Transformers, while memory and compute usage scale linearly with sequence length.\n\n**Architectural_Symptoms**: When replacing softmax with Hedgehog attention, observe a restoration of \"spiky\" attention distributions and monotonicity with respect to query-key similarity, correlating with improved metric scores and stable training dynamics.",
        "BACKGROUND": "**Title**: The Hedgehog & the Porcupine: Expressive Linear Attentions with Softmax Mimicry\n\n**Historical Technical Context**: Prior to this work, sequence modeling was dominated by architectures like RNNs, LSTMs, and especially Transformers, which use softmax-based self-attention to capture long-range dependencies. Standard Transformer attention computes pairwise interactions between all tokens, resulting in quadratic time and memory complexity with respect to sequence length. Linear attention methods emerged to address this, approximating softmax attention using kernel-based feature maps to achieve linear complexity.\n\n**Technical Limitations**: Despite their efficiency, existing linear attentions often suffered from significant performance drops compared to softmax attention, failing to match its ability to focus sharply (\"spiky\" weights) and maintain monotonicity with respect to query-key similarity. These limitations manifested as higher perplexity, reduced accuracy, and instability when converting or training models, especially in large-scale or finetuning scenarios. Efficient linear attention methods struggled to combine expressivity with computational scalability.\n\n**Paper Concepts**: - **Linear Attention:** An attention mechanism replacing the softmax with a kernel-based feature map ϕ, enabling O(n) complexity:  yᵢ = ϕ(qᵢ) · Σⱼ ϕ(kⱼ)ᵗvⱼ / ϕ(qᵢ) · Σⱼ ϕ(kⱼ).\n- **Spikiness (Low-Entropy Attention):** The property where attention weights are sharply peaked, allowing selective focus on relevant tokens—crucial for model expressivity.\n- **Monotonicity:** Attention weights increase monotonically with the query-key dot product, ensuring stable and interpretable behavior.\n- **Softmax Mimicry:** Learning feature maps (e.g., via MLPs) to approximate softmax attention weights, aligning linear attention’s behavior with standard attention.\n- **Attention Distillation Loss:** A training objective minimizing the cross-entropy between linear and softmax attention weights to guide feature map learning.\n\n**Experimental Context**: The paper evaluates models on tasks requiring language modeling, reasoning, reading comprehension, and text generation, assessing both accuracy and efficiency. Evaluation emphasizes both training from scratch and converting existing models, measuring the ability to recover or match standard attention quality. The philosophy centers on closing the expressivity gap while maintaining linear scalability, using diverse tasks to test generalization and robustness.",
        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**: Hedgehog replaces the fixed kernel feature map in linear attention with a simple, trainable single-layer MLP, parameterized separately for each attention head/layer, and explicitly trained to mimic the softmax attention distribution using a cross-entropy distillation loss. The MLP applies an element-wise exponential activation to enforce \"spikiness,\" and is optimized so that the resulting attention weights closely match those produced by the softmax operation.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**: By learning a feature map that directly mimics softmax attention weights, Hedgehog restores two crucial properties lost in prior linear attentions: (1) low-entropy, highly selective (\"spiky\") attention distributions and (2) monotonicity with respect to query-key dot products. This enables the model to retain the expressive power of softmax attention while enjoying linear time and space complexity.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**:\n- Linear attention output:  \n  \\( y_i = \\frac{\\phi(q_i)^T \\sum_{j=1}^i \\phi(k_j) v_j}{\\phi(q_i)^T \\sum_{j=1}^i \\phi(k_j)} \\)\n- Hedgehog feature map:  \n  \\( \\phi_{mlp}(x) = [\\exp(w_1^T x + b_1), ..., \\exp(w_{d'}^T x + b_{d'})] \\)\n- Distillation loss for each query \\(q_i\\):  \n  \\( L_i = -\\sum_{j=1}^i \\text{softmax}(q_i^T k_j) \\cdot \\log \\left(\\frac{\\phi_{mlp}(q_i)^T \\phi_{mlp}(k_j)}{\\sum_{m=1}^i \\phi_{mlp}(q_i)^T \\phi_{mlp}(k_m)}\\right) \\)\n\n**Computational_Properties**:  \n- Time/space complexity: \\( O(nd^2) \\) (linear in sequence length, quadratic in head dimension)\n- Highly parallelizable across sequence, heads, and batch\n- Memory and compute scale linearly with sequence length, enabling efficient training/inference for long contexts\n- Training efficiency is comparable to standard Transformers, with no additional overhead after distillation",
        "IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE": "**Integration_Strategy**:  \n- Replace each attention head’s fixed feature map (ϕ) with a trainable single-layer MLP as described.\n- Apply the MLP after the standard query/key projections but before value aggregation.\n- During (pre)training or model conversion, use the distillation loss to match softmax attention weights; after distillation, proceed with standard training objectives.\n\n**Parameter_Settings**:  \n- MLP is a single linear layer (weight matrix \\( W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d'} \\), bias \\( b \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d'} \\)), followed by element-wise exp.\n- \\( d' \\) (feature dimension) should match or slightly exceed head dimension \\( d \\) for expressivity; typical range: \\( d' = d \\) to \\( 2d \\).\n- Initialize MLP weights as identity (or small random values) for stable start; tune learning rate for distillation phase.\n- Use separate MLPs per head and per layer for maximum expressivity.\n\n**Application_Conditions**:  \n- Use when seeking to scale LLMs to longer contexts without quadratic compute/memory costs, or when converting existing models to linear attention for efficiency.\n- Most beneficial when prior linear attentions show degraded performance on tasks requiring selective focus, context integration, or reasoning.\n- Apply distillation loss during conversion or pretraining; for training from scratch, standard end-to-end optimization suffices.\n\n**Expected_Outcomes**:  \n- Expect near-parity with softmax attention models on all core language modeling, reasoning, and comprehension metrics (training loss, lambada_openai, boolq, arc_easy/challenge, squad_completion, etc.).\n- Dramatic improvement over previous linear attention methods on context-sensitive and selective reasoning tasks (lambada_openai, winogrande, hellaswag).\n- Training curves and final losses similar to softmax models, but with linear memory and compute scaling—enabling longer contexts and larger batch sizes."
