        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures**: \n- Smoother and more stable training loss curves, with reduced variance and fewer spikes during optimization. \n- Improved performance on language modeling tasks requiring long-range context (lambada_openai, hellaswag), as stable feature maps prevent degradation at longer sequence lengths.\n- Enhanced factual and reasoning task scores (arc_easy/arc_challenge, boolq, openbookqa) due to more reliable gradient propagation and reduced feature explosion/vanishing.\n- Minimal or positive effect on structured data extraction (swde) and reading comprehension (squad_completion), as normalization stabilizes feature representations across tasks.\n\n**Architectural_Symptoms**: \n- Training runs exhibit fewer instabilities and less sensitivity to sequence length or initialization; models using exponential feature maps with variance scaling converge more reliably than those using ReLU or ELU feature maps.",

Earlier alternatives included recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) units, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), each with their own limitations in capturing long-range dependencies or efficient parallelization. Linear attention mechanisms emerged to address the inefficiency of softmax attention by approximating attention computation with feature maps, reducing complexity to linear time and space.\n\n**Technical Limitations**: Despite their efficiency, early linear attention models often lagged behind softmax attention in modeling quality and training stability, partly due to unstable feature mappings and simplistic update rules. Gated linear attention introduced gating mechanisms to control memory updates, but suffered from gate saturation (vanishing gradients) and further instability without proper normalization. These limitations restricted both the performance and practical deployment of efficient language models for long sequences.\n\n**Paper Concepts**: - **Feature Mapping Function** (ϕ): Transforms input vectors into a new space to approximate softmax attention; e.g., ϕ(x) = exp(x - max(x)).\n- **Normalization Layer**: A module applied after attention computation to stabilize gradients and control variance, crucial for training deep or long-sequence models.\n- **Gating Mechanism**: A parameterized function (e.g., sigmoid-based) that controls the update of hidden states, allowing selective forgetting or retention of information.\n- **Refined Gate**: An enhanced gating mechanism that interpolates between different activation regimes to prevent saturation and improve gradient flow.\n\n**Experimental Context**: The model is evaluated on a variety of language understanding and generation tasks, including causal language modeling, commonsense reasoning, and question answering. Both training-from-scratch and continual pretraining (post-linearization) scenarios are considered to test adaptability and performance recovery. Evaluation emphasizes average performance across diverse task types to assess generalization and practical efficiency.",

        "IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE": "**Integration_Strategy**: \n- Replace the feature map in all linear attention modules with the normalized exponential mapping and variance reduction scaling.\n- Insert the scaling factor directly into the attention computation after the feature map inner product.\n\n**Parameter_Settings**: \n- Feature dimension d: higher values improve performance but with diminishing returns; typical ranges are 32–96.\n- Weight matrices (Wq, Wk): initialize as in standard transformers (e.g., Xavier or Kaiming).\n- Scaling factor: 1/(e√d(e²−1)) is analytically derived and should be applied as-is.\n\n**Application_Conditions**: \n- Use when observed training instability or performance degradation occurs with standard linear attention, especially with long sequences or continual pretraining after attention replacement.\n\n**Expected_Outcomes**: \n- Training loss curves will be smoother and converge more reliably.\n- Language modeling (lambada_openai, hellaswag), factual reasoning (arc_easy/arc_challenge, openbookqa), and reading comprehension (squad_completion) will see consistent or improved performance relative to prior linear attention methods.\n- No significant increase in computational cost; memory and speed remain competitive with other linear attention approaches."
