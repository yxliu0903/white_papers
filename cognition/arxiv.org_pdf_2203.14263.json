        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**: Instead of computing a single scalar attention weight per value vector, multi-dimensional attention assigns a separate attention weight to each dimension (element) of each value vector. Attention scoring and alignment are performed for every feature dimension, producing a matrix of attention weights that modulate each element of the value vectors before aggregation.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**: This approach enables the model to selectively focus on specific aspects of input representations, rather than treating each feature vector as a whole, leading to more precise information extraction and better handling of complex, heterogeneous data.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**:\n- For each value vector \\( v_l \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_v} \\), compute attention score vector \\( e_l \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_v} \\).\n- For each feature dimension \\( i \\), apply softmax across all positions:  \n  \\( a_{l,i} = \\frac{\\exp(e_{l,i})}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n_f} \\exp(e_{j,i})} \\).\n- Aggregate context:  \n  \\( c = \\sum_{l=1}^{n_f} a_l \\odot v_l \\), where \\( \\odot \\) is element-wise multiplication.\n\n**Computational_Properties**: Increases memory and computation by a factor of \\( d_v \\) compared to standard attention, but remains parallelizable across both sequence positions and feature dimensions. May require careful memory management for large models, but can be efficiently implemented on modern accelerators.",
        "IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE": "**Integration_Strategy**: Replace standard attention layers in the transformer (or other LLM architectures) with multi-dimensional attention modules, particularly in layers where fine-grained feature selection is critical (e.g., middle or upper layers in encoder stacks). Ensure that both the attention scoring and alignment steps are extended to operate over feature dimensions.\n\n**Parameter_Settings**: Adjust the output size of attention score projections to match the value vector dimensionality. Initialization should follow standard practices (e.g., Xavier/He initialization), but consider scaling down if dimensionality is high. Hyperparameter tuning may involve regularization (dropout, weight decay) to prevent overfitting due to increased parameterization.\n\n**Application_Conditions**: Most beneficial when downstream tasks require extracting or reasoning over specific attributes or facets of input data (e.g., entity recognition, multi-hop QA, or structured information extraction). Monitor for diminishing returns on tasks dominated by global context or sequence-level understanding.\n\n**Expected_Outcomes**: Expect sharper improvements on tasks involving fine-grained reasoning or feature extraction (e.g., squad_completion, swde, boolq, arc_easy/challenge, openbookqa), with smoother and potentially faster convergence during training. May increase model interpretability by revealing which input dimensions are most relevant for each prediction."

        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures**: Incorporating multi-head and multi-hop attention in LLMs is expected to yield robust improvements in tasks requiring integration of multiple information types and reasoning steps. Look for elevated scores on lambada_openai (long-range dependencies), hellaswag (contextual plausibility), winogrande (pronoun/context resolution), and arc_challenge/openbookqa (multi-step reasoning). Training loss should decrease more rapidly, and few-shot adaptation (fda) may benefit due to enhanced representational diversity.\n\n**Architectural_Symptoms**: Attention heatmaps will show diverse focus patterns across heads and hops. Training runs may exhibit improved stability and less overfitting due to distributed representational capacity.",

        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**: Multi-head attention splits queries, keys, and values into multiple subspaces, applying parallel attention modules (“heads”) that each learn to focus on different aspects of the input. Multi-hop attention iteratively refines representations by stacking attention modules, where each hop’s output is used as input for the next, allowing for deeper, multi-step reasoning.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**: Multi-head attention increases the representational diversity, letting the model attend to multiple relationships simultaneously. Multi-hop attention enables the model to iteratively integrate and refine information, supporting complex reasoning chains and context aggregation.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**:\n- Multi-head: For each head \\( j \\),  \n  \\( c^{(j)} = \\text{Attn}(QW_q^{(j)}, KW_k^{(j)}, VW_v^{(j)}) \\)  \n  Final output: \\( c = W_O [c^{(1)}; \\ldots; c^{(h)}] \\)\n- Multi-hop: For hop \\( s \\),  \n  \\( c^{(s)} = \\text{Attn}(Q^{(s)}, K, V) \\),  \n  \\( Q^{(s+1)} = \\text{Transform}(Q^{(s)}, c^{(s)}) \\)\n\n**Computational_Properties**: Multi-head is highly parallelizable and scales linearly with the number of heads. Multi-hop (deep stacking) increases sequential computation but can be mitigated with residual connections and layer normalization. Both approaches increase model capacity and can be balanced against computational cost.",
        "IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE": "**Integration_Strategy**: Incorporate multi-head attention in all transformer attention layers. For multi-hop, stack multiple attention blocks (as in deep transformers), optionally sharing or varying parameters across hops. Consider using residual connections and normalization to stabilize deep stacking.\n\n**Parameter_Settings**: Number of heads typically set as a divisor of embedding size (e.g., 8, 12, 16). Number of hops (layers) should be tuned based on task complexity and available compute. Use standard initialization and regularization strategies; monitor for overfitting as depth increases.\n\n**Application_Conditions**: Most beneficial for tasks with complex, multi-faceted context requirements (narrative understanding, multi-hop QA, commonsense inference). Watch for diminishing returns or increased latency on tasks dominated by shallow or local dependencies.\n\n**Expected_Outcomes**: Expect broad improvements across context-heavy and reasoning-intensive metrics (lambada_openai, hellaswag, winogrande, arc_challenge, openbookqa, social_iqa), with more robust generalization and improved adaptation to new data. Training loss curves should show smoother, faster convergence, especially in larger models."
