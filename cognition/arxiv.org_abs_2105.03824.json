        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures**: \n- Expect training loss to decrease faster and reach a plateau more quickly, especially at longer sequence lengths, due to significant computational speedups.\n- On tasks requiring broad context and semantic understanding (e.g., squad_completion, lambada_openai, hellaswag), performance remains within 92-97% of standard Transformer encoders. \n- For tasks heavily reliant on precise, token-level dependencies or nuanced reasoning (e.g., arc_challenge, winogrande, openbookqa), expect a modest performance drop compared to full attention but still superior to unstructured mixing or feedforward-only baselines.\n- On structured extraction and pattern recognition tasks (swde), performance is maintained or slightly improved due to efficient mixing.\n- Commonsense and factual reasoning (boolq, piqa, social_iqa) remain robust but may not reach the very top scores of BERT-like models.\n\n**Architectural_Symptoms**: \n- Noticeably reduced GPU/TPU memory usage and FLOPS per forward pass; much faster wall-clock training times. Model convergence is more stable for small/medium models.",

        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**: \n- Replace each self-attention sublayer in the Transformer encoder with a 2D Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) applied to the input tensor (sequence length × hidden size). Specifically, apply a 1D DFT along the sequence dimension and another along the hidden dimension, keeping only the real part.\n- No learnable parameters are introduced in this mixing layer; all learning is handled by the feed-forward sublayers and embeddings.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**: \n- The Fourier Transform efficiently mixes global information across tokens by projecting the input into the frequency domain, enabling each token to access information from all others with O(N log N) complexity, thus sidestepping the quadratic cost of self-attention while retaining essential sequence-wide interactions.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**: \n- For input \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d_h} \\):\n  - \\( y = \\mathrm{Re}(\\mathrm{DFT}_{\\text{seq}}(\\mathrm{DFT}_{\\text{hid}}(x))) \\)\n  - Where \\( \\mathrm{DFT}_{\\text{seq}} \\) applies a DFT along the sequence axis and \\( \\mathrm{DFT}_{\\text{hid}} \\) along the hidden dimension; Re denotes taking the real part.\n\n**Computational_Properties**: \n- Time complexity: O(n d_h \\log n + n d_h \\log d_h) per layer (using FFT).\n- No additional memory for layer parameters; reduced memory usage during forward/backward passes.\n- Highly parallelizable, especially on GPUs with fast FFT implementations.\n- Training is more stable for small/medium models due to absence of parameterized mixing weights.",

Ensure the real part is extracted after both DFTs.\n\n**Parameter_Settings**: \n- No hyperparameters for the Fourier mixing itself. Standard Transformer hyperparameters apply for embedding size, feed-forward width, number of layers, etc.\n- For very long sequences, prefer FFT implementations; for shorter sequences on TPUs, matrix multiplication with cached DFT matrices may be faster.\n\n**Application_Conditions**: \n- Use when training/inference speed and memory efficiency are critical, especially for long sequence or resource-constrained deployments.\n- Particularly effective for classification, extraction, and tasks where global mixing suffices; less suitable for tasks requiring fine-grained, token-specific dependencies or generative decoding.\n\n**Expected_Outcomes**: \n- Expect significant speedup in training and inference (1.5–2x or more), lighter memory footprint, and competitive accuracy on most language understanding benchmarks.\n- Slight drop in maximum achievable accuracy on tasks requiring nuanced attention patterns, but superior efficiency and stability for small/medium models."
