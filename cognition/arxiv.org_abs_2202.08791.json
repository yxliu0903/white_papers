        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures**: \n- Models using this design (ReLU-activated linear attention) exhibit faster training convergence (lower training loss curves), maintain or slightly improve perplexity on language modeling tasks, and show stable or improved performance on context-sensitive tasks (lambada_openai, hellaswag) and factual reasoning tasks (boolq, arc_easy/challenge, openbookqa).\n- Compared to other linear/kernalized attention methods, this approach avoids the performance collapse on narrative/contextual and reasoning metrics, especially on long sequences.\n\n**Architectural_Symptoms**: \n- Training and validation loss curves drop more rapidly and smoothly than vanilla transformers, with no instability spikes seen in kernel-based approximations. Performance on tasks requiring context aggregation (winogrande, squad_completion) remains robust.",
        "BACKGROUND": "**Title**: cosFormer: Rethinking Softmax in Attention\n\n**Historical Technical Context**: Prior to cosFormer, dominant sequence modeling architectures included RNNs and LSTMs, which processed tokens sequentially, and Transformers, which introduced parallelizable self-attention using softmax-normalized dot-product attention.

        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**: \n- Replace the softmax attention with a linear attention mechanism where the similarity function is computed as the dot product between ReLU-activated queries and keys: \\( S(Q, K) = \\text{ReLU}(Q) \\cdot \\text{ReLU}(K)^\\top \\).\n- This ensures all entries in the attention matrix are non-negative, eliminating the aggregation of negatively correlated (irrelevant) contextual information.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**: \n- The ReLU non-linearity enforces non-negativity, which empirically stabilizes attention distributions and prevents the model from attending to unhelpful (negatively correlated) tokens. This preserves the key regularization property of softmax without incurring quadratic complexity or approximation errors found in kernel-based methods.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**: \n- Attention output for token \\( i \\):  \n  \\[\n  O_i = \\frac{\\sum_j \\text{ReLU}(Q_i) \\cdot \\text{ReLU}(K_j)^\\top V_j}{\\sum_j \\text{ReLU}(Q_i) \\cdot \\text{ReLU}(K_j)^\\top}\n  \\]\n- Linearization:  \n  \\[\n  O = \\text{ReLU}(Q) \\left( \\text{ReLU}(K)^\\top V \\right) / \\text{ReLU}(Q) \\left( \\text{ReLU}(K)^\\top \\mathbf{1} \\right)\n  \\]\n\n**Computational_Properties**: \n- Reduces time and space complexity from \\( O(N^2) \\) to \\( O(N) \\) for sequence length \\( N \\).\n- Highly parallelizable, as all matrix multiplications are decomposed and can exploit GPU/TPU batch operations.\n- Memory usage scales linearly with sequence length, enabling efficient training and inference on long sequences.",
        "IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE": "**Integration_Strategy**:\n- Replace the standard softmax attention block in transformer layers with a module that applies ReLU to queries and keys before the attention computation.\n- Ensure normalization in the denominator as in standard attention to maintain output scale.\n\n**Parameter_Settings**:\n- Use standard initialization for linear layers, but ensure ReLU activations are not followed by bias terms that could lead to excessive zeroing.\n- Keep the head dimension \\( d \\) much smaller than sequence length \\( N \\) to maximize efficiency.\n- No temperature or scaling parameter is needed as in softmax; monitor for potential output magnitude drift.\n\n**Application_Conditions**:\n- Apply when quadratic attention is a computational bottleneck, especially for long sequence tasks or memory-constrained environments.\n- Particularly beneficial when kernel-based or low-rank approximations degrade performance on context-sensitive or reasoning tasks.\n\n**Expected_Outcomes**:\n- Expect smoother and faster convergence of training loss, robust performance on both context-heavy and reasoning tasks (lambada_openai, hellaswag, boolq, arc_easy/challenge, openbookqa), and efficient scaling to long sequences without the instability of kernel approximations."
