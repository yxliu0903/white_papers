        "DESIGN_INSIGHT": "### DESIGN_INSIGHT_1: Recurrence of Gating and Implicit Long Convolutions as a Subquadratic Attention Replacement\n\nHyena introduces a novel operator for sequence modeling that replaces self-attention with a stack (recurrence) of two subquadratic primitives: (1) data-controlled element-wise multiplicative gating and (2) implicitly parameterized long convolutions. Each layer alternates between these, with the depth of recurrence controlling expressivity. The long convolution filters are parameterized by a small feed-forward network (FFN) over positional encodings, allowing the model to decouple memory length from parameter count and achieve unbounded context with sublinear parameter scaling.",
        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures**: \n- Improved modeling of long-range dependencies and context should manifest as higher lambada_openai, hellaswag, and winogrande scores, with smoother and lower training loss curves compared to quadratic attention, especially on long sequences.\n- Reasoning and factual tasks (boolq, arc_easy/challenge, openbookqa) should match or closely approach Transformer baselines, as the operator supports unrestricted context and high expressivity.\n- Commonsense and social reasoning (piqa, social_iqa) performance remains stable or improves due to better memory and context integration.\n- For very long contexts (e.g., squad_completion on long passages, swde), expect robust extraction and recall, with runtime and memory usage scaling subquadratically.\n- Data augmentation/few-shot generalization (fda) is preserved due to in-context learning.\n**Architectural_Symptoms**: \n- Training logs show faster convergence on long-sequence tasks, with memory and runtime scaling much better than attention-based models as sequence length increases.",

        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**: \n- Replace each self-attention block with a stack of N alternating operations: (a) multiplicative gating by learned projections of the input, and (b) long 1D convolutions, where the convolution filter is generated by a small FFN applied to positional encodings and modulated by an exponential window. The recurrence is: \\( z_1 = v_t \\); for \\( n = 1..N \\), \\( z_{n+1} = x^n_t \\cdot (h^n * z_n)_t \\); output \\( y = z_{N+1} \\).\n**Key_Mechanism**: \n- The multiplicative gating allows dynamic, data-dependent control of information flow (akin to attention's data-controlled linearity), while the implicit long convolution enables efficient, flexible modeling of dependencies across arbitrary distances without parameter explosion or quadratic cost.\n**Mathematical_Formulation**: \n- For input \\( u \\), projections \\( v, x^1, ..., x^N \\), and filters \\( h^1, ..., h^N \\):\n  \\[\n  z_1 = v_t \\\\\n  z_{n+1} = x^n_t \\cdot (h^n * z_n)_t \\quad \\text{for } n=1..N \\\\\n  y = z_{N+1}\n  \\]\n  Each convolution is computed via FFT: \\( (h * u) = \\text{iFFT}(\\text{FFT}(h) \\cdot \\text{FFT}(u)) \\).\n  Filters: \\( h^n_t = \\text{Window}(t) \\cdot \\text{FFN}(\\text{PosEnc}(t)) \\).\n**Computational_Properties**: \n- Time complexity: \\( O(N L \\log L) \\) per layer (with N small, e.g., 2–4), subquadratic in sequence length.\n- Memory: No quadratic attention matrix; parameters scale sublinearly with context length.\n- Parallelization: FFT-based convolutions and FFN filter generation are highly parallelizable across sequence and batch.\n- Training efficiency: Lower memory footprint allows larger context or batch size; faster wall-clock training for long sequences.",
        "IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE": "**Integration_Strategy**: \n- Replace each attention block in the Transformer with the Hyena operator: insert a stack of N alternating gating and long convolution modules in place of multi-head attention.\n- Use the same input/output shapes as attention for compatibility with standard residual and normalization layers.\n- Retain feed-forward (MLP) blocks between Hyena layers as in standard architectures.\n**Parameter_Settings**: \n- Number of recurrences N: typically 2–4 for strong expressivity.\n- FFN size for filter generation: small (e.g., 2–3 layers, width ~64–256).\n- Positional encoding: Sine/cosine or learned, dimension 8–32.\n- Exponential window decay parameter: tune per channel to regularize filter length.\n- Initialize FFN weights using standard small-variance schemes; window bias to avoid zeroing filters.\n**Application_Conditions**: \n- Use when sequence lengths exceed 2K or when memory/runtime of attention is prohibitive.\n- Especially beneficial for tasks requiring long-context recall, in-context learning, or efficient scaling to large batches/sequences.\n**Expected_Outcomes**: \n- Expect training loss to decrease more smoothly on long-sequence tasks, with perplexity and downstream metric parity or improvement over attention for long-range and context-heavy benchmarks (lambada_openai, hellaswag, winogrande, squad_completion, swde).\n- Compute and memory cost scale subquadratically, enabling larger context windows without hardware bottlenecks."

This implicit parameterization enables the filter to have length equal to the sequence, supporting unbounded context and capturing both low- and high-frequency patterns, while keeping parameter count independent of sequence length.",
