Enhanced performance is also expected on arc_easy/arc_challenge and openbookqa due to better factual recall from improved local context modeling. Minor but consistent boosts in winogrande and piqa may occur due to more robust context encoding.\n\n**Architectural_Symptoms**: Training curves should show faster convergence and reduced overfitting, especially on long-sequence or context-heavy tasks; models display increased robustness to sequence length variation and mild improvements in generalization to unseen sequence lengths.",

        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**: Replace the standard Transformer attention sub-layer with a composite mechanism that first applies a multi-dimensional, damped EMA to the input sequence before attention is computed. Each input dimension is expanded into a higher-dimensional space, and EMA is applied per-dimension with learnable decay and damping factors. This output is then used as the contextualized input for a single-head gated attention unit.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**: EMA injects a strong, learnable local inductive bias—favoring recent context and exponentially decaying the influence of distant tokens—while still allowing the attention mechanism to model global dependencies. The learnable, multi-dimensional nature of EMA enables flexible adaptation to different modalities and sequence types, overcoming the inductive bias deficit of vanilla attention.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**:  \nFor each input dimension \\( j \\):\n\n\\[\nu^{(j)}_t = \\phi_j x_{t,j}\n\\]\n\\[\nh^{(j)}_t = \\beta_j \\odot u^{(j)}_t + (1 - \\beta_j \\odot \\epsilon_j) \\odot h^{(j)}_{t-1}\n\\]\n\\[\ny_{t,j} = \\lambda_j^T h^{(j)}_t\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\phi_j, \\beta_j, \\epsilon_j, \\lambda_j\\) are learnable parameters (possibly vectors), and \\(\\odot\\) denotes elementwise multiplication. The EMA output \\(Y^* = \\text{EMA}(X)\\) is used as the input to the attention/gating unit.\n\n**Computational_Properties**:  \n- Time/space complexity: Linear in sequence length for the EMA step; overall complexity dominated by the attention step (quadratic unless chunking is applied).\n- Memory: Slightly increased due to expanded dimensions but amortized over sequence length.\n- Parallelization: EMA can be efficiently implemented as convolutions and parallelized across batch and feature dimensions.\n- Training efficiency: Faster convergence and improved stability due to stronger inductive bias.",
        "IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE": "**Integration_Strategy**:  \nReplace the standard attention sub-layer in each Transformer block with a Mega block:  \n1. Apply multi-dimensional EMA to the input sequence.\n2. Feed the EMA output into a single-head gated attention unit (see Cognition 2).\n3. Follow with feed-forward and normalization layers as usual.\n\n**Parameter_Settings**:  \n- EMA expansion dimension \\( h \\): tune per modality (e.g., 4–32).\n- Decay and damping coefficients (\\(\\beta, \\epsilon\\)): initialize in (0, 1), learnable per-dimension.\n- EMA projection weights (\\(\\phi, \\lambda\\)): initialize as small random values.\n- EMA can be disabled (h=0) for ablation; performance drops indicate its importance.\n\n**Application_Conditions**:  \n- Most beneficial for tasks where local context is critical (long-form language, reading comprehension, science QA).\n- Particularly effective when Transformers show slow convergence or overfit on long-context or structured tasks.\n- Can be used as a drop-in replacement for standard attention in any Transformer-like architecture.\n\n**Expected_Outcomes**:  \n- Smoother, faster training convergence and improved generalization.\n- Consistent improvements on context-heavy and reading comprehension benchmarks (lambada_openai, squad_completion, hellaswag).\n- Enhanced robustness to variable sequence lengths and modalities."
