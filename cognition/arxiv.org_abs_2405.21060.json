        "DESIGN_INSIGHT": "### DESIGN_INSIGHT_1: State Space Duality (SSD) — Unified Structured Matrix View for Sequence Models\n\nThe core insight of the paper is that **state-space models (SSMs) and attention mechanisms are duals of each other through the lens of structured (semiseparable) matrices**. This duality enables the design of architectures (e.g., Mamba-2) that can be computed both as efficient linear-time recurrences (like SSMs) and as quadratic-time attention-like operations, depending on the computational regime and hardware. The SSD framework leverages block decompositions of semiseparable matrices to combine the efficiency of SSMs with the parallelizability and hardware-friendliness of attention.",
        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures**: \n- Models using SSD layers should show **training loss curves that converge faster** and with lower wall-clock time compared to vanilla SSMs or Transformers, especially at long sequence lengths.\n- **Long-range context tasks (lambada_openai, hellaswag, winogrande, squad_completion, MQAR)** should show robust or improved performance due to improved state capacity and efficient information propagation.\n- **Commonsense and factual reasoning tasks (arc_easy/challenge, openbookqa, boolq, piqa, social_iqa)** should maintain or slightly improve, as SSD layers can scale state size without major efficiency penalties, supporting richer representations.\n- **swde and fda**: Pattern recognition and few-shot adaptation should remain stable or improve due to efficient sequence mixing.\n- **Efficiency metrics**: SSD-based models should outperform both attention and SSM baselines in throughput (tokens/sec) and memory usage at large sequence lengths or state sizes.\n\n**Architectural_Symptoms**: \n- Training logs show lower GPU memory usage per token at long sequence lengths and larger state sizes, and profiler traces reveal high utilization of matrix multiplication units (tensor cores).",
