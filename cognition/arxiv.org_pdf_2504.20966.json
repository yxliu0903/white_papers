        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm**: \n- Replace the softmax function in the attention mechanism with the \"softpick\" function, defined as:  \n  Softpick(x)_i = ReLU(exp(x_i - m) - exp(-m)) / (sum_j |exp(x_j - m) - exp(-m)| + ε),  \n  where m = max(x), ε is a small constant for numerical stability, and ReLU/abs operate elementwise.\n- This function allows attention scores to be exactly zero (sparse), removes the sum-to-one constraint, and maintains gradient flow for negative inputs via the denominator.\n\n**Key_Mechanism**: \n- By breaking the sum-to-one normalization, softpick prevents the forced allocation of attention to irrelevant tokens (e.g., BOS), directly eliminating attention sinks.\n- Rectification (ReLU) in the numerator ensures sparsity, while the absolute value in the denominator allows negative inputs to contribute to normalization, maintaining gradient flow and avoiding dead heads.\n- The result is hidden activations with dramatically reduced outlier magnitude (lower kurtosis), enabling more effective quantization and low-precision training.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation**:\n- Softpick(x)_i = ReLU(exp(x_i - m) - exp(-m)) / (Σ_j |exp(x_j - m) - exp(-m)| + ε)\n- Jacobian ∂s_i/∂x_j combines step and sign functions to maintain non-vanishing gradients for all inputs.\n\n**Computational_Properties**: \n- Drop-in replacement for softmax in attention; compatible with efficient implementations (e.g., FlashAttention-2).\n- Enables sparse attention computation, reducing unnecessary value multiplications.\n- Lower risk of overflow/underflow in activations; improved quantization and low-precision training stability.\n- No increase in parameter count or need for custom optimizers.",
        "IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE": "**Integration_Strategy**: \n- Replace the softmax normalization in the attention computation (i.e., after QK^T/√d_k) with the softpick function in all transformer attention layers.\n- Ensure numerically stable implementation (subtract max, add ε).\n- Leverage existing sparse attention or FlashAttention kernels if possible.\n\n**Parameter_Settings**: \n- ε: Small constant (e.g., 1e-6) for denominator stability.\n- No new trainable parameters.\n- May require retuning of learning rate, gradient clipping, or scaling of QK^T for larger models to maintain stability and performance.\n\n**Application_Conditions**: \n- Strongly recommended when quantization, low-precision training, or interpretability are priorities, especially in small to medium models (<1B params).\n- Particularly beneficial for deployment scenarios requiring low memory, low-latency, or aggressive model compression.\n- For very large models or long-context tasks, monitor for underscaling in sparse attention heads and adjust scaling as needed (though naive scaling may not resolve all issues).\n\n**Expected_Outcomes**: \n- Eliminates attention sink (sink rate 0%) and massive activations, leading to more stable and compressible activations.\n- Quantized models retain higher accuracy at low bit-widths, with less performance degradation.\n- Training loss and downstream task performance are comparable to softmax in smaller models, but may require tuning for larger models.\n- Attention maps are highly sparse and more interpretable; dormant heads are trivially prunable.\n- May not improve, and can slightly degrade, long-context retrieval or large-model performance unless further adaptations are made."
