        "DESIGN_INSIGHT": "### DESIGN_INSIGHT_1: Fully Data-Controlled Linear Recurrence via Input-Dependent State Transitions\n\nGateLoop introduces a generalized linear recurrent architecture where not only the input and output gates, but also the state transition matrix, are controlled by the input data at each timestep. This enables the model to dynamically adjust its memory retention and forgetting behavior based on the content of the sequence, rather than using fixed or parameter-tied transitions as in S4, S5, LRU, or RetNet.",
        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Task_Performance_Signatures**: \n- Improved modeling of long-range dependencies manifests as significant gains in lambada_openai and hellaswag, with smoother and lower training loss curves.\n- Enhanced ability to retain or forget context on demand leads to better performance on tasks requiring flexible memory, such as winogrande (pronoun resolution), squad_completion (reading comprehension), and arc_easy/challenge (science QA).\n- Tasks with abrupt context shifts or requiring selective memory (e.g., boolq, openbookqa) show increased robustness, especially when context resets or topic changes are present.\n\n**Architectural_Symptoms**: \n- Training logs show more stable gradients and consistent convergence across sequence lengths; ablation of data-controlled transitions leads to sharper degradation on tasks with long or interrupted contexts.",
